<p class="pc4 elarge">HISTORICAL PARALLELS.</p>

<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="pn2">Works of history may be divided into two great classes:
those which select a single action or a detached period
for their subject; and those which follow a nation
through the whole or a large portion of its existence;
and which, embracing a number of such subjects, compensate
for giving less minute and accurate information
upon each, by explaining their relation, and the influence
which they have exerted upon each other. To the
former belong Thucydides, Xenophon, and Cæsar; to
the latter Diodorus and Livy: or, in English literature,
we may take Clarendon and Hume respectively as the
representatives of these divisions. It is obvious that the
method of treating themes so different in character, must
also be essentially different; that for an historian of the
latter class to aim at the particularity which we expect
in the former, would involve something of the same
absurdity as if a landscape painter were to give to an
extended horizon the distinctness and detail which are
proper to his foregrounds or to a closely bounded scene.
If our curiosity is not satisfied by a comprehensive view,
the remedy is to be found by multiplying pictures of its
most striking parts, not by introducing into one canvas
a multitude of objects which must fatigue and confuse
the mind, and obscure those leading features which ought
to stand out in prominent relief. Any one who wished
to become acquainted with the nature and characteristics
of a country, which he could not survey personally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
would neither confine his inspection to bird’s&ndash;eye and
panoramic views, nor content himself with a series
of detached paintings, though representing separately
whatever was most worthy of observation: in the one
case his ideas, though perhaps correct, would necessarily
be slight and superficial; in the other, his knowledge
of the parts would never enable him to form an
accurate judgment of the whole.</p>

<p>Valuable, therefore, as is the assistance of those
authors who have devoted their talents and learning to
epitomizing and rendering accessible the story of past
ages, it is far from desirable that we should content ourselves
with a blind trust in them, without checking their
assertions, and filling up their sketches by a more detailed
knowledge than it is possible for them to communicate.
To apply these observations to the present work, the
History of Greece contained in the Library of Useful
Knowledge necessarily gives a very short account of
many things which deserve to be known in detail, both
on account of their historical notoriety and for the intrinsic
value which they possess as striking examples of
human power, passion, and suffering. Much of the excessive
commendation which has been bestowed upon
ancient virtue and patriotism ought probably to be attributed
to the eager interest naturally excited by the revival
of learning and the peculiar circumstances under
which it took place. The discovery of the works of the
most celebrated writers of antiquity, whose names at
least had not been forgotten, must at any time have produced
much curiosity and excitement: and peculiarly so
when modern literature did not yet possess many names
to divide the palm of genius with them. Besides this
the political circumstances of the Italian states, in which
the new discoveries were at first most successfully and
generally prosecuted, would give an additional interest
and a peculiar bias to the study of ancient literature;
for their inhabitants would naturally be disposed, as
Italians, to exult in the glories of ancient Italy, and as
republicans to look for patterns both of polity and of
conduct among the famous republics of Greece and Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
A contrary cause, in a later age, and in countries subject
to arbitrary power, would probably conduce to the continuance
of the same feeling, when the prevalent subjection
of public opinion made it safer to enforce sentiments
of freedom and patriotism under the mask of an overstrained
admiration for actions, frequently of very questionable
character, done in times long past, than openly
to profess the love of republican simplicity and liberty,
which was willingly left to be inferred. The usual
course of education long tended, and in an inferior
degree perhaps still tends, to cherish the same indiscriminate
enthusiasm. The first histories put into the
hands of children are usually those of Greece and Rome,
taken not from the sober and comparatively unprejudiced
relations of the earliest authorities, but from Plutarch,
and other compilers of a later age, who, living themselves
under despotic power, and compelled to veil their
philosophical aspirations after a better state of polity and
morals under extravagant praises of a by&ndash;gone period of
imaginary virtue and disinterestedness, were for the most
part ready to warp truth into correspondence with their
own views. In such works actions are held up to admiration
because they are brilliant, without much inquiry
whether they were justifiable; wanton and unjust
aggressions, and other crimes of still deeper dye, are
glossed over upon some false plea of patriotism; or their
moral quality is never alluded to, and the young reader
is too much captivated by the splendour of bravery and
talent, to remember that the ends to which these gifts
are directed should never be forgotten in estimating
their claim to applause.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But whatever be our opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
touching Grecian and Roman virtue, or the moral character
of the most celebrated portions of their history,
these have obtained a degree of currency and notoriety
which render familiar acquaintance with them almost
necessary for the full understanding of much even of
modern literature. The object of this work is to supply,
in part, these details from the original historians, and to
compare or contrast them with other remarkable incidents
of ancient or modern times; in hope of forming a
collection of narratives of some interest to those who are
not largely read in history. And even those who are
in some degree familiar with the subjects here treated,
but whose knowledge is chiefly drawn from compilations
of modern date, may be gratified by the variety in style,
feelings, and opinions observable in a collection of extracts
from authors of various dates and nations.</p>

<p>We have selected from the Grecian History, in chronological
order, as furnishing the readiest principle of
arrangement, a series of occurrences of which some have
obtained remarkable notoriety; some, being less known,
are either striking in themselves, or characteristic of the
age and people to which they belong; and finally some,
with less intrinsic value, may serve to introduce curious
or instructive matter of comparison. To every person
well acquainted with the subject, many things will probably
occur, of which the omission may be regretted. Completeness,
however, is evidently unattainable in an undertaking
of this sort, and the passages taken from Grecian
history have necessarily been regulated in part by the correspondences
which presented themselves in the histories
of other nations. It has been our object to draw examples
from a great variety of sources; from different
countries, in different ages, and in different states of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
civilization: and to show that no particular virtues or
vices have been inherent in any age or nation: believing
that human nature and human passions are everywhere
alike, and that the great differences in national character
are mainly to be ascribed to external circumstances and
training. Comparisons of contrast, therefore, are no less
valuable than comparisons of resemblance, when we can
trace the causes which have produced a difference in
conduct. It only remains to add, that we have not
always thought it necessary to require a close analogy
either of motives or of actions.</p>

<p>The instances chosen have not been very strictly confined
to what rests upon undoubted testimony. Perhaps
we learn little less of the habits and opinions of men, from
ascertaining what they have believed of others, than from
knowing what they have done themselves; and, therefore,
even works of fiction may be resorted to in some
degree, care being taken to distinguish the character of
the authorities. For example, we should have no hesitation
in quoting even from the Mort d’Arthur, and still
more from the earlier romances on which it is founded,
in illustration of the manners of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, in which those romances were written;
or, though on different grounds, the admirable narratives
of the plagues of Florence and London by Boccaccio and
Defoe, which probably are no less trustworthy for the
character of the narrative, and in a great degree for the
facts themselves, than Thucydides’ description of the
plague at Athens. Again, there is a sort of debateable
ground, where genuine history begins to gain the ascendant
over fable, as in the case of Aristomenes and
Wallace, where we cannot tell, nor is it important to know,
the exact measure of truth contained in the legends concerning
them. The outlines of their lives we have reason
to believe to be correct, and rejecting from their exploits
all that is grossly improbable, the remainder will furnish
us with a sufficiently clear idea of the accomplishments
and adventures of a warrior of their respective ages.
The poem of Blind Harry abounds in improbable
fictions, but much more information concerning Wallace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and his contemporaries may be gained from it than from
the meagre chronicles which composed the graver
literature of the age. From such sources, therefore, we
shall not scruple to borrow, though not without advertising
the reader of their nature, and endeavouring,
where necessary, to draw the boundary line between
truth and fiction.</p>

<p>For reasons above stated, our extracts have usually
been taken from contemporary authors, or at least from
the earliest authorities extant. Where this rule has
been departed from, it is because the originals offer no
striking passages to select, and are too prolix to be
given entire. In this case, condensation becomes necessary,
and we have gladly availed ourselves of the labours
of others who have already performed that task, in preference
to seeking novelty at the expense perhaps of
accuracy or elegance. For the same reason existing
translations have been used, whenever a good translation
of the particular passage could be found. Where none
such occurred, we have endeavoured to adhere closely to
our author, and even where his narrative has been much
compressed, to give, as far as was possible, not only his
substance, but his words.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">Mythic period of Grecian history&mdash;Savage state of Greece
compared with that of Scandinavia&mdash;Anecdotes of Northern
warriors&mdash;Hercules&mdash;Theseus&mdash;State of Greece in
their time, illustrated by that of England subsequent to
the Conquest&mdash;Argonautic expedition&mdash;Theban war&mdash;Story

<p class="pn">The traditions from which our knowledge of what is
called the mythic age of Greece, or the age of fable,
from the earliest notices of it to the Trojan war, is
almost entirely derived, furnish few materials for a
work like this, for where everything is misty and undefined,
there can be little opportunity for comparison.
The wonderful poetic talent displayed in their narration
and embellishment has, however, given them a
place in history, and an importance otherwise undeserved,
and men study the actions and genealogy of an
Achaian prince, as gravely as if he had been really the
descendant of Jupiter, and the conqueror of monsters
and oppressors innumerable. It becomes the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
interesting therefore to inquire into the actual condition
of Greece in its earliest times, and ascertain, if
possible, whether the godlike men, sprung from the
Gods, of whose superhuman powers and exploits succeeding
ages have read, until by the mere force of
repetition they have half believed them, had in reality
any advantage over barbarians of other races and regions.
To guide us in the inquiry we have two sorts of
information, totally distinct in their nature: the meagre
notices of authentic history, and a copious store of
mythological and poetical legends. So far as the former
is available, we have no reason to think that the
heroic age had much advantage over those dark times
in which the foundations of modern Europe were laid.
Passing over the account given by Thucydides of the
earliest inhabitants of Greece as being applicable to
any savage race, in the next stage of society, when the
arts had somewhat advanced, in the reign of Minos, the
first person perhaps of whom any rational and credible
account is given, a code of honour existed which made
strength not only the first but the sum&ndash;total of all virtues,
and filled the sea with pirates and the land with
robbers.</p>

<p>“Minos was the most ancient of all that by report
we know to have built a navy, and he made himself
master of the now Grecian sea, and both commanded the
Isles called Cyclades,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and also was the first who sent
colonies into most of the same, expelling thence the
Carians, and constituting his own sons there for governors,
and also freed the sea from pirates as much as
he could, for the better coming in, as is likely, of his
own revenue.</p>

<p>“For the Grecians in old time and such barbarians<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
as in the continent lived near unto the sea or else inhabited
the islands, when they began more often to
cross over to one another in ships, became thieves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
went abroad under the conduct of their most puissant
men, both to enrich themselves and to fetch in maintenance
for the weak: and falling upon towns unfortified,
and scatteringly inhabited, rifled them, and made this
the best means of their living; being at that time a matter
nowhere in disgrace, but rather carrying with it
something of glory. This is manifest by some that
dwell on the continent, among whom, so it be performed
nobly, it is still esteemed as an ornament. The
same also is proved by some of the ancient poets, who
introduce men questioning such as sail by, on all coasts
alike, whether they be thieves or not;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as a thing
neither scorned by such as were asked, nor upbraided
by those that were desirous to know. They also robbed
one another within the main land: and much of Greece
useth that old custom, as the Locrians called Ozolæ
(or <i>Stinkards</i>), the Acarnanians, and those of the continent
in that quarter unto this day. Moreover the
fashion of wearing iron remaineth yet with the people
of that continent from their old trade of thieving.</p>

<p>“For once they were wont throughout all Greece
to go armed, because their houses were unfenced and
travelling unsafe, and accustomed themselves like the
barbarians to the ordinary wearing of their armour.
And the nations of Greece that live so yet, do testify
that the same manner of life was anciently universal to
all the rest.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>A condition of society identical with that described
in the latter part of this extract still exists among the
Curdish and Caucasian and other Asiatic mountaineers,
and existed till lately in the Scottish Highlands. But
descriptions of the latter have been multiplied, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
they have become familiar in men’s mouths as household
terms; and we pass in preference to a less hackneyed
subject. In the eighth and ninth centuries the piratical
spirit of ancient Greece was revived among those fierce
Danes and Norwegians, who led a life of constant rapine
and bloodshed; of interminable warfare at home, of
frightful devastation abroad. “The Sea&ndash;kings of the
North were a race of beings whom Europe beheld with
horror. Without a yard of territorial property, with
no wealth but their ships, no force but their crews, and
no hope but from their swords, they swarmed upon the
boisterous ocean, and plundered in every district that
they could approach.... It is declared to have been
a law or custom in the North, that one of the male
children should be selected to remain at home to inherit
the government. The rest were exiled to the ocean, to
wield their sceptres amid the turbulent waters. The
consent of the northern societies entitled all men of
royal descent, who assumed piracy as a profession, to
enjoy the name of kings, though they possessed no
territory. The sea&ndash;kings had the same honour, but they
were only a portion of those pirates, or <i>vikingr</i>, who in
the ninth century were covering the ocean. Not only
the children of the kings, but every man of importance
equipped ships, and roamed the seas to acquire property
by force. Piracy was not only the most honourable
occupation and the best harvest of wealth; it was not
only consecrated to public estimation by the illustrious
who pursued it, but no one was esteemed noble, no one
was respected, who did not return in the winter to his
home with ships laden with booty.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Part of the
regulations of a band of pirates is preserved by Bartholinus,
and may serve as a specimen of the better class,
though the reader may not be inclined to agree with
him in considering them as men “devoted to virtue,
bravery, and humanity, rather than to the oppression of
innocent persons.” These regulations were called the
Constitutions of King Half. “No one might wear a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
sword more than an ell in length, that they might be
compelled to close in battle. Each was to be equal in
strength to twelve ordinary men. They made prisoners
neither women nor boys. None was to bind his wounds
until the lapse of twenty hours. These men everywhere
infested the land, and everywhere were victorious.
They lay at anchor at the ends of headlands. They
never raised bulwarks on their ships’ sides, and never lowered
their sails, let the wind blow as it would.
Their captain never had in his ship more than sixty
men.” No less creditable were the ordinances of Hialmar,
the sum of which was, that his men should plunder
neither traders nor husbandmen; that they should
neither rob women of their money, nor carry them off
against their consent: and should not eat raw flesh.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The fiercer class indulged in this disgusting food, and
washed it down suitably with draughts of blood. Savage
in all things, it was an amusement to toss infants from
one to another, and catch them on the points of their
lances. Many used to work themselves literally into
a state of bestial ferocity. Those who were subject to
these paroxysms were called Berserkir: they studied to
resemble wild beasts; they excited themselves to a
strength which has been compared to that of bears; and
this unnatural power was succeeded, as we may well
suppose, by corresponding debility. In the French and
Italian romances, we frequently find a warrior endowed,
for a part of the day, with a double or treble share of
strength; and it is not improbable that the fiction may
have been derived from this species of frenzy, which is
thus described by the Danish historian, Saxo Grammaticus.
“Sivald had seven sons, so skilled in magic,
that, impelled by the sudden access of fury, they used
often to howl savagely, to gnaw their shields, to devour
live coals, and rush fearlessly into fire; and this passion
could only be appeased by confinement in fetters, or by
human blood.” This Sivald and Haldan were rivals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
for the Swedish crown. Sivald challenged Haldan to
decide their quarrel by contending alone with himself
and his seven sons. The latter answered that the
legitimate form of the duel did not admit of more than
two. “No wonder,” replied his antagonist, “that a
man without wife or offspring, whose mind and body are
alike deficient in warmth, should refuse the proffered
encounter. But my children, who own me as the author
of their existence, and myself, have one common origin,
and must be considered as one man.” The force of the
argument was admitted, and, in obedience to this modest
request, Haldan knocked out the brains of the eight.</p>

<p>The same warrior was challenged by another Berserkir,
named Harthben, who always had twelve chosen
men in attendance to prevent his doing mischief when
the fit was upon him. Upon hearing that Haldan
undertook to fight himself and his followers, he was
seized with a paroxysm which was not subdued until he
had killed six of them, by way of trying his hand: and
then he was killed by his antagonist, as he richly deserved,
for throwing away half his chance.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> So also we
read that Odin could blunt the weapons of his enemies;
that his soldiers went to battle without armour, biting
their shields, raging like wolves or dogs: like bears or
bulls in strength, they slaughtered their foes, and were
themselves invulnerable to fire and sword.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> At length,
however, this passion changed from a distinction to
a reproach, and was ultimately prohibited by penal
laws.</p>

<p>Harold Harfager, or the Fairhaired, who consolidated
Norway under his sceptre, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 910, cleared the Northern
Ocean from the scourge of piracy, as did Minos the
Grecian seas. Still the spirit of depredation was alive.
The spread of Christianity moderated the excesses of
the Northmen, but it was long ere their fondness for
freebooting was extinguished; nay, the very rites of
religion were employed to give a sanction to robbery.
Maritime expeditions seemed to the Danes pious and necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that they might protect themselves from the
incursions of their Sclavonic neighbours on the continent,
and piracy was therefore practised under certain laws,
which in the opinion of Bartholinus breathe a spirit of
defence rather than of aggression. “Pirates had power
to take such ships as appeared suited to their purpose,
even without consent of the owners, upon payment of
one&ndash;eighth of the booty by way of hire. Before a voyage
they made confession to the priests, and having undergone
penance, they received the sacrament, as if at
the point of death, believing that things would go more
prosperously if they duly propitiated God before war.
Content with their food and armour, they avoided burdening
their vessels, and took nothing that could delay
their voyage. Their watches were frequent, their mode
of life sparing. They slept leaning upon their oars.
Their battles were numerous: their victory ever easy,
and almost bloodless. The booty was shared equally,
the master receiving no larger portion than a common
rower. Those Christians whom they found enslaved in
the captured vessels, they presented with clothing, and
dismissed to their own homes.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The frantic ravages of these barbarians have been described
by the sufferers, and belong in part to our own
history; while those committed by the unknown tribes
who two thousand years before occupied the other extremity
of Europe, are long since forgotten, or remembered
only in the flattering traditions of their countrymen.
The former, therefore, are known and execrated,
while the latter stand fair with the world: and in the
absence of evidence, we are far from wishing to impute to
them that bestial ferocity which so often disgraced the
Northmen: but who can compare the passages just given
with that quoted from Thucydides, without being convinced
that they refer to corresponding periods of civilization,
and describe similar principles, if not similar modes of
action? And as the best historical accounts which we
can procure represent the feelings and habits of the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Greeks as closely akin to those of our own barbarous ancestors,
so their traditions and fables lead us to the same
conclusion. The Scaldic poems bear, indeed, a more savage
cast; some say from the inhospitable rigour of our
northern sky; but more probably because we possess
them in their original or nearly their original state,
while the earliest Greek compositions extant were written
in an age comparatively civilized. But the heroes of
both were actuated by the same spirit. Siegfrid and
Wolf Dietrich differ little but in external ornament from
Castor, or Achilles, or Diomed; their pride was in the
same accomplishments, their delight in the same pleasures,
their hope in an immortality of the same sensual
enjoyments.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Some sketch of the life of Starchaterus, a purely fictitious
person, may serve as a specimen of these stories.</p>

<p>Starchaterus was born in Sweden, a few years after the
Christian era. He was of giant stature, and of strength
and courage correspondent to the magnitude of his frame,
so that in prowess he was held inferior to none of mortal
parentage; and, as he excelled all in bodily endowments,
so his life was protracted to three times the usual duration
of human existence. Like his great prototype, the
Grecian Hercules, he traversed the neighbouring regions,
and went even to Ireland and Constantinople in quest
of adventures; but, unlike him, he was animated by a
most intolerant hatred of everything approaching to luxury,
insomuch that he treated an invitation to dinner as
an insult, and inflicted severe punishment upon all who
were so imprudently hospitable as to request his company.
For it was the mark of a buffoon and parasite, he said, to
run after the smell of another man’s kitchen, for the sake
of better fare.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In other respects the severity of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
manners was more commendable; when he found any of
the classes who live by the follies or vices of mankind
mixing with soldiers, he drove them away with the
scourge, esteeming them unworthy to receive death from
the hands of brave men. In addition to his other accomplishments,
he was skilled in poetry, and persecuted
luxury in verse no less successfully than by corporeal inflictions,
as is evident from certain of his compositions,
which have been translated into Latin by Saxo Grammaticus.</p>

<p>He went to Russia on purpose to fight Visin, who possessed
the power of blunting weapons with a look, and
trusting in this magic power, exercised all sorts of cruelty
and oppression. Starchaterus rendered the charm of no
avail by covering his sword with thin leather, and then
obtained an easy victory.</p>

<p>Nine warriors of tried valour offered to Helgo, king
of Norway, the alternative of doing battle singly
against the nine, or losing his bride upon his marriage&ndash;day.
Helgo thought it best to appear by his champion,
and requested the assistance of Starchaterus, who was so
eager for the adventure, that in following Helgo to the
appointed place, in one day, and on foot, he performed a
journey which had occupied the king, who travelled on
horseback, during twelve days. On the morrow, which
was the appointed day, ascending a mountain, which was
the place of meeting, he chose a spot exposed to the
wind and snow, and then, as if it were spring, throwing
off his clothes, he set himself to dislodge the fleas that
nestled in them. Then the nine warriors ascended the
mountain on the other side, and showed the difference of
their hardihood by lighting a fire in a sheltered spot.
Not perceiving their antagonist, one went to look out
from the mountain top, who saw at a distance an old
man covered with snow up to the shoulders. They
asked him if it were he who was to fight with them, and
being answered in the affirmative, inquired further, whether
he would receive them singly or all together. His
reply was rather more churlish than the question deserved:
“When the dogs bark at me, I drive them off all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
together, and not one by one.” Then, after a severe
battle, he slew them all.</p>

<p>At last, being overtaken by age, he thought it fit to
terminate his life before his glory was dimmed by decrepitude;
for men used to consider it disgraceful for a
warrior to perish by sickness. So he hung round his
neck one hundred and twenty pounds of gold, the spoil
of one Olo, to buy the good offices of an executioner,
thinking it fit that the wealth which he had obtained by
another man’s death should be spent in procuring his
own. And meeting Hather, whose father he had formerly
slain, he exhorted him to take vengeance for that
injury, and pointed out what he would gain by doing so.
Hather willingly consented, and Starchaterus, stretching
out his neck, bade him strike boldly, adding, for his encouragement,
that if he leaped between the severed head
and the trunk before the latter touched the earth, he
would become invincible in arms. Now, whether he said
this out of good will, or to be quits with his slayer, who
ran a good chance of being crushed by the falling giant,
is doubtful. The head, stricken off at a blow, bit the
earth, retaining its ferocity in death: but Starchaterus’
real meaning remained unknown, for Hather showed his
prudence by declining to take a leap, which had he taken,
he might never have leaped again.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>This is an early and rude specimen of an errant knight;
the same character which was afterwards expanded into
Roland and Launcelot, the paladins and peers of Charlemagne
and Arthur, worthies closely allied to the heroes
of Homer and Hesiod. The triple&ndash;bodied Geryon, the
Nemean lion and Lernæan hydra, the deliverance of
Andromeda by Perseus, the capture of the golden fleece,
and above all, perhaps, Amycus, who compelled all
strangers to box with him, till he was beaten by Pollux,
and bound by oath to renounce the practice, are entirely
in unison with the spirit and imagery of chivalric romance.
Examples to this effect might easily be multiplied.
But an essay on the fictions of the Greeks would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
be foreign to the scope of this publication: and it would
be absurd to enter upon a critical investigation of a series
of stories, extended by some chronologers over seven
centuries, from the foundation of Argos to the Trojan
war, while Newton contracts them within a century and
a half, which tell of little but bloodshed, abductions,
and violence of all sorts, intermixed, however, with
notices of those who invented the useful arts and fostered
the gradual progress of civilization. As we approach
to the Trojan war, a sort of twilight history begins to
dawn upon us. It is to what may seem at first the
strongholds of fiction, to the exploits of Hercules and
Theseus, that we refer. The earliest ascertained fact is
the establishment of a regular government by Minos,
who also cleared the sea from pirates. At no long
interval the above&ndash;named heroes made another step in
civilization; they cleared the land from rapine, as Minos
had cleared the sea. Other men, roaming in search of
adventures, had carried bloodshed through the land at
the suggestion of their passions or for the advancement
of their fame; but Hercules first traversed the earth
with the express design of avenging the oppressed and
exterminating their oppressors, and the example was
soon after followed by his kinsman Theseus. Their
exploits, of course, are chiefly fabulous: but it is worthy
of observation that those of Theseus approach much
nearer to probability than the far&ndash;famed labours of Hercules.
Indeed the history of the former presents this
peculiarity, that the accounts of his youth are consistent,
and scarcely improbable, while those of his age run into
all the extravagance of romance. Theseus, travelling
from Tr&oelig;zen to Athens, was strongly urged to go by sea,
the way by land being beset with robbers and murderers.
He refused to do so, being inflamed with emulation of
Hercules’ renown; and on the journey signalized himself
by slaying Sinnis, surnamed the Pine&ndash;bender, because
he dismembered travellers by tying them to the tops of
trees forcibly brought together and then allowed to start
asunder; Procrustes, who exhibited a passion for uniformity
worthy a German general of the old school, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
reducing all men to the measure of his own bed, by
stretching those who were too short, and docking those
who were too long; together with others of less note,
and similar habits. That Plutarch believed in these
stories is evident, from the tone in which he recites them;
a corroboration, indeed, of no great weight, for he proceeds
with equal gravity to relate things which no one
will credit; but in this instance his account of the state
of Greece gives warranty for his belief, and is itself
confirmed by our knowledge of later ages. The passage
has often been quoted, but it is striking and to the purpose,
and its want of novelty, therefore, shall be no bar
to its insertion. “The world at that time brought forth
men, which for strongness in their arms, for swiftness of
their feet, and for a general strength of the whole body,
did far pass the common force of others, and were
never weary for any labour or travail they took in hand.
But for all this, they never employed these gifts of
nature to any honest or profitable thing; but rather
delighted villainously to hurt and wrong others; as if all
the fruit and profit of their extraordinary strength had
consisted in cruelty and violence only, and to be able to
keep others under and in subjection; and to force, destroy,
and spoil all that came to their hands. Thinking that
the more part of those which think it a shame to do ill,
and commend justice, equity, and humanity, do it of
faint, cowardly hearts, because they dare not wrong
others, for fear they should receive wrong themselves;
and, therefore, that they which by might could have
vantage over others, had nothing to do with such qualities.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The enormities ascribed to Sinnis and his fellows have
discredited the whole train of adventures to which they
belong; but this is an untenable ground of doubt. He
who reads descriptions of the state of England, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
laws were strong enough to control private violence,
given by contemporaries who saw what they relate, and
whose narratives bear the impress of sincerity, will better
appreciate the extent of human ferocity. In the reign
of Stephen disorder was at its height. “The barons
cruelly oppressed the wretched men of the land with
castle&ndash;works, and when the castles were made, they
filled them with devils and evil men. Then took they
those whom they supposed to have any goods, both by
night and day, labouring men and women, and threw
them into the prison for their gold and silver, and inflicted
on them unutterable tortures: for never were any
martyrs so tortured as they were. Some they hanged up
by the feet, and smoked them with foul smoke, and some
by the thumbs, or the head, and hung coats of mail on
their feet. They tied knotted cords about their heads,
and twisted them until the pain went to their brains.
They put them into dungeons where were adders, and
snakes, and toads, and so destroyed them. Some they
placed in a crucet house; that is, in a chest that was
short and narrow, and not deep, wherein they put sharp
stones, and so thrust the man therein, that they broke all
the limbs. In many of the castles were things loathsome
and grim, called Sachenteges, of which two or three men
had enough to bear one. They were thus made: they
were fastened to a beam, having a sharp iron to go about
a man’s throat, so that he could in no direction either
sit, or lie, or sleep, but bear all that iron. Many thousands
they wore out with hunger. I neither can, nor
may I tell all the wounds and pains which they inflicted
on wretched men in this land.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>“Some, seeing the sweetness of their country turned
into bitterness, went into foreign parts: others built hovels
about churches in hope of security, and there passed life
in fear and pain, subsisting for lack of food (for famine
was felt dreadfully over all England) upon the forbidden
and unused flesh of dogs and horses, or relieving hunger
with raw herbs and roots, until throughout the provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
men, wasted by famine, died in crowds, or went voluntarily
with their families into a miserable exile. You
might see towns of famous name, standing lonely, and altogether
emptied by the death of their inhabitants of all
ages and sexes; the fields whitening under a thriving
harvest, but the husbandman cut off by pestilential famine
ere it ripened: and all England wore the face of grief
and calamity, of misery and oppression. In addition to
these evils, the savage multitude of barbarians who resorted
to England for the gains of warfare was moved
neither by the bowels of piety nor by any feeling of
human compassion for such misery: everywhere they
conspired from their castles to do all wickedness, being
always at leisure to rob the poor, to promote quarrels,
and intent everywhere upon slaughter with all the malice
of a wicked mind.” Even churchmen amused themselves
with these pastimes. “The bishops themselves,
as I am ashamed to say, not all indeed, but many of them,
clad in handsome armour, rode up and down on prancing
horses with these upsetters of their country; shared in
their booty; exposed to fetters, or torture, knights, or
any wealthy persons soever, whom they intercepted; and
being themselves the head and cause of all this wickedness,
they threw the blame not on themselves, but only
upon their followers.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Enough of general descriptions, which are fully borne
out by the particulars related. “In the reign of Stephen,
Robert, the son of Hubert, had gotten possession of the
castle of Devizes. He was a man exceeding all within
memory in barbarity and blasphemy, who used freely to
make boast, that he had been present when twenty&ndash;four
monks were burnt together with their church, and profess
that he would do as much in England, and ruin utterly
the abbey of Malmesbury. If he ever dismissed a prisoner
unransomed, and without the torture, which very seldom
happened, at such times, when they thanked him in God’s
name, I have with these ears heard him answer, ‘God
will never own the obligation to me.’ He would expose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
his captives naked to the burning sun, anointed with
honey, to attract flies, and such other tormenting insects.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
This worthy met with a fit end, being taken
and hanged; but this act of retribution was one of illegal
violence, being done by a knight who held Marlborough
Castle, without a shadow of authority, and apparently on
the principle that any one had a right to abate a nuisance.</p>

<p>“In these times (the reign of William Rufus) men
come not to great name but by the highest wickedness.
Thomas, a great baron near Laudun in France, was
great in name, because he was extreme in wickedness. At
enmity with the surrounding churches, he had brought
all their wealth into his own exchequer. If any one by
force or guile were holden in his keeping, truly might
that man say, ‘the pains of hell got hold upon me.’
Murder was his glory and delight. Against all usage,
he placed a countess in a dungeon, whom the foul ruffian
harassed with fetters and torments to extort money.
He would speak words of peace to his neighbour, and
stab him to the heart with a smile, and hence, under his
cloak, he more often wore his sword naked than sheathed.
Therefore, men feared, respected, worshipped him. All
through France was he spoken of. Daily did his estate,
his treasure, his vassalage increase. Wouldst thou hear
the end of this villain? Being stricken with a sword unto
death, refusing to repent, and turning away his head
from the Lord’s body, in such manner he perished: so
that it might well be said, ‘Befitting to your life was
that death.’ You have seen Robert de Belesme, a
Norman baron, who when established in his castle was
Pluto, Megæra, Cerberus, or anything that can be named
more dreadful. He took pains not to dismiss, but to dispatch
his captives. Pretending to be in play, he put out
his son’s eyes with his thumbs, while he was muffled up
in a cloak; he impaled persons of both sexes. Horrid
slaughter was as a meat pleasant to his soul: therefore
was he found in all men’s mouths, so that the wonderful
doings of Robert de Belesme passed into proverbs. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
us come at length to the end. He who had afflicted
others in prison, being at last thrown into prison by
King Henry, ended his wicked life by an enduring
punishment.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>It was this state of disorder which produced knight&ndash;errantry,
and there is nothing absurd in believing that
equal lawlessness in another country was checked by the
same sort of interference. The reality of knight&ndash;errantry
has, indeed, been questioned; it has been pronounced
a fiction, suited to the wants of the period in which it was
supposed to exist. If this were so, and the tales of
Hercules and Theseus equally groundless, it would still
be curious to see that men had been led to imagine the
same means of making amends for the want of an executive
power: but we do not believe this to be the
case. The romances gave system and consistency to the
scattered acts of individuals; they described the better
qualities of knighthood in their own days, and filled up
the picture with imaginary virtues and preter&ndash;human
prowess, attributes which men are always ready to confer
on their ancestors, as Nestor makes the heroes with
whom he fought in youth far superior to those whom he
lectured in old age, and Homer endows those who fought
under Troy with the strength of three or four men,
“such as mortals now are.” But their productions bear
the stamp of copies, not originals, and it is not very easy
to believe that they would have invented, or their audience
and readers relished, characters and rules of action
for which their own experience gave no warrant.</p>

<p>There is, however, a double Theseus, of historic as
well as legendary fame. In his latter capacity, both for
the degree of reality and the nature of his exploits, he
may be compared to Arthur; in his former, still to draw
an illustration from British history, he is not unworthy
to be placed by the side of Alfred. The union of these
two, discordant as it may appear, is not more so than
that of the poetic and the historical Theseus. Alfred,
indeed, signalised his military talents in many hard&ndash;fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fields, but his victories were those of a general:
the exploits of Theseus were those of a knight. But
among the mass of stories of questionable truth or unquestioned
falsehood relating to him, it is generally acknowledged
that this man, whose very existence we
might else have doubted, was the author of extensive
and judicious reforms in government, such as proved
the foundation of Attic greatness: reforms which he
effected by the rarest and most virtuous of all sacrifices,
the resignation of his own power.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Attica was divided
into twelve districts, shires we might call them, except
that, taken all together, they were less than one of the
larger English counties. Professedly forming one body,
and owning a precarious obedience to one prince, they
had still their petty and conflicting interests, and could
with difficulty be induced to concur in any measures for
the benefit of the whole. Theseus, encouraged by the
popularity which he had gained by delivering Athens
from its subjection to Crete,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> undertook to substitute a
better polity. “He went through the several towns,
and persuaded the inhabitants to give up their separate
councils and magistrates, and submit to a common jurisdiction.
Every man was to retain his dwelling and his
property as before; but justice was to be administered
and all public business transacted at Athens. The
mass of the people came into his measures, and to
subdue the reluctance of the powerful, who were loath to
resign the importance accruing from the local magistracies,
he gave up much of his own authority, reserving
only the command of the army, and the care of watching
over the execution of the laws. Opposition was silenced
by his liberality, together with the fear of his power,
ability, and courage, and the union of Attica was effected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
by him and made lasting. To bind it closer, without
disturbing the religious observances of the several towns,
he instituted a common festival in honour of Minerva,
which was called the feast of union, and (<i>Panathenæa</i>)
the feast of all the Athenians.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>This process bears some resemblance to the consolidation
of the Saxon Heptarchy, nominally effected by
Egbert, but completed and made truly beneficial by
Alfred. The evils which were to be reformed were
very different in the two cases: at Athens civil dissension
was to be remedied; in England a rude people,
intermixed with foreign barbarians more ferocious than
themselves, and reduced to poverty by a series of destructive
invasions, required a strong curb for the re&ndash;establishment
of order and security. We must not expect,
therefore, to find any resemblance between their institutions:
the Saxons required no measures to prevent
civil war, and inspire a spirit of nationality; the Athenians,
though well inclined to civil broils, respected,
from the earliest dawn of history, the security of property,
and in consequence far outstripped the rest of
Greece in wealth and refinement. Nevertheless the
names of these princes may fairly be selected to adorn
the same page: both advanced beyond their age in
legislative and political science; both directed their
wisdom, power, and popularity to truly noble ends; and
therefore merit the respect of all who believe rank and
office to have been instituted for other ends than for the
advantage of those who possess them.</p>

<p>We have spoken of Hercules and Theseus as indicating
the commencement of Grecian history. Previous to
them, facts are mentioned which we have no ground to
disbelieve, as the various settlements by Ph&oelig;nician or
Egyptian emigrants; but all further particulars of these
persons, with the exception of Minos, are of such a nature,
that where we find no internal evidence to pronounce
them fabulous we can yet assign but scanty reasons for relying
confidently upon their truth. But about this era our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
knowledge begins to increase. We must refer to it an
event of which it is not easy to fix the date with certainty;
namely, the celebrated Argonautic expedition, in which
both these heroes are said to have joined: a statement,
however, irreconcileable with the accounts of Theseus’
introduction to Ægeus, and the plot formed against him
by Medea.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Without troubling ourselves to account
for these discrepancies, it is evident that the expedition,
if it ever took place, which there seems reason to believe
in spite of Bryant’s opposition, who would ascribe this,
and almost all other legends, to some faint traditions
of the deluge and preservation of Noah, must have
borne a close resemblance to the Danish piratical excursions
which we have already described. Not long
after occurs the first confederate war mentioned in
Grecian history, that of the Seven against Thebes;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> an
event so closely connected with mythology that its reality
might reasonably be questioned, but for the testimony of
Homer and Hesiod. The revolting nature of the
struggle between two brothers, for the kingdom of a
banished, miserable, and neglected father, would incline
us indeed to give as little credit to the concluding tragedy
of the house of Laius, as to the series of crimes and
misery by which that house had been polluted: but all
arguments founded upon the horrors of such fratricidal
warfare fall to the ground, when in the brightest period
of chivalry we find it revived with no less rancour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a no less fatal end, and the flower of French knighthood
a calm spectator, nay, almost an actor in the scene.
The strife between Don Pedro of Castile, and his
brother Henry of Transtamara, the deadly struggle in
which Pedro, who had already slain one brother, fell,
when defeated and a prisoner, by the dagger of another
against whom his own hand was armed, involve circumstances
of horror scarce less adapted to dramatic effect
than those legends which have so often employed the
Greek tragedians.</p>

<p>Don Pedro was the legitimate heir to the crown of
Castile. Don Henry and Don Fadrique (or Frederick)
were his half&ndash;brothers by Donna Leonora de Guzman,
whom their father had entertained as his mistress, and
even proclaimed queen, during the life&ndash;time of his lawful
wife. When Pedro succeeded to the throne, at his
mother’s instigation he put her rival to death: his brothers,
Henry and Fadrique, escaped, and the former renounced
his allegiance: the latter fled into Portugal;
but after some time he made his peace, returned, and
was appointed master of the order of St. Iago. When
several months had elapsed, he was invited to join the
court at Seville, and take his share in the amusements
of an approaching tournament. He accepted the invitation,
but was sternly and ominously received, and immediately
executed within the palace. The friends of Pedro
asserted, that the king had, that very day, detected
Don Fadrique in a correspondence with his brother
Henry and the Arragonese; while popular belief attributed
the slaughter of the master to the influence of
Pedro’s mistress, Maria de Padilla. The circumstances
of this event are powerfully described in one of the
Spanish ballads, so admirably translated by Mr. Lockhart.
There is a peculiarity of construction in the ballad,
the person of the narrator being changed in the course of
it. It is commenced by the victim himself, who describes
the alacrity with which he obeyed his brother’s
summons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">I sat alone in Coimbra&mdash;the town myself had ta’en,&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppi2">When came into my chamber a messenger from Spain:</p>
<p class="ppi2">There was no treason in his look, an honest look he wore,</p>
<p class="ppi2">I from his hand the letter took&mdash;my brother’s seal it bore.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">“Come, brother dear, the day draws near (’twas thus bespoke the king)</p>
<p class="ppi2">For plenar court and nightly sport, within the listed ring.”</p>
<p class="ppi2">Alas, unhappy master, I easy credence lent:</p>
<p class="ppi2">Alas, for fast and faster I at his bidding went.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">When I set out from Coimbra, and passed the bounds of Spain,</p>
<p class="ppi2">I had a goodly company of spearmen in my train;</p>
<p class="ppi2">A gallant force, a score of horse, and sturdy mules thirteen;</p>
<p class="ppi2">With joyful heart I held my course, my years were young and green.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">A journey of good fifteen days within the week was done,</p>
<p class="ppi2">I halted not, though signs I got, dark tokens many a one;</p>
<p class="ppi2">A strong stream mastered horse and mule, I lost a poniard fine,</p>
<p class="ppi2">And left a page within the pool, a faithful page of mine.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">Yet on to proud Seville I rode&mdash;when to the gate I came,</p>
<p class="ppi2">Before it stood a man of God to warn me from the same:</p>
<p class="ppi2">The words he spake I would not hear, his grief I would not see;</p>
<p class="ppi2">“I seek,” I said, “my brother dear&mdash;I will not stop for thee.”</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">No lists were closed upon the sand, for royal tourney dight,</p>
<p class="ppi2">No pawing horse was seen to stand, I saw no armed knight:</p>
<p class="ppi2">Yet aye I gave my mule the spur, and hasted through the town,</p>
<p class="ppi2">I stopt before his palace&ndash;door, then gaily leapt I down.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">They shut the door&mdash;my trusty score of friends were left behind;</p>
<p class="ppi2">I would not hear their whispered fear, no harm was in my mind;</p>
<p class="ppi2">I greeted Pedro, but he turned&mdash;I wot his look was cold;</p>
<p class="ppi2">His brother from his knee he spurned&mdash;“Stand off, thou master bold.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">“Stand off, stand off, thou traitor strong!” ‘twas thus he saith to me,</p>
<p class="ppi2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>“Thy time on earth shall not be long&mdash;what brings thee to my knee?</p>
<p class="ppi2">My lady craves a new year’s gift, and I will keep my word;</p>
<p class="ppi2">Thy head methinks may serve the shift&mdash;good yeoman, draw thy sword&mdash;“</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">The master lay upon the floor, ere well that word was said,</p>
<p class="ppi2">Then in a charger off they bore his pale and bloody head.</p>
<p class="ppi2">They brought it to Padilla’s chair, they bowed them on the knee&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppi2">“King Pedro greets thee, lady fair, his gift he sends to thee.”</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">She gazed upon the master’s head, her scorn it could not scare,</p>
<p class="ppi2">And cruel were the words she spoke, and proud her glances were.</p>
<p class="ppi2">“Thou now shalt pay, thou traitor base, the debt of many a year,</p>
<p class="ppi2">My dog shall lick that haughty face, no more that lip shall sneer.”</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">She seized it by the clotted hair, and o’er the window flung:</p>
<p class="ppi2">The mastiff smelt it in his lair, forth at her cry he sprung;</p>
<p class="ppi2">The mastiff that had crouched so low, to lick the master’s hand,</p>
<p class="ppi2">He tossed the morsel to and fro, and licked it on the sand.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">And ever as the mastiff tore, his bloody teeth were shown,</p>
<p class="ppi2">With growl and snort he made his sport, and picked it to the bone!</p>
<p class="ppi2">The baying of the beast was loud; and swiftly on the street</p>
<p class="ppi2">There gathered round a gaping crowd to see the mastiff eat.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">Then out and spake King Pedro&mdash;“What governance is this?</p>
<p class="ppi2">The rabble rout the gate without torment my dogs, I wiss.”</p>
<p class="ppi2">Then out and spake King Pedro’s page&mdash;“It is the master’s head,</p>
<p class="ppi2">The mastiff tears it in his rage, therewith they have him fed.”</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">Then out and spake the ancient nurse, that nursed the brothers twain&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppi2">“On thee, King Pedro, lies the curse; thy brother thou hast slain;</p>
<p class="ppi2">A thousand harlots there may be within the realms of Spain,</p>
<p class="ppi2">But where is she can give to thee thy brother back again?”</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">Came darkness o’er King Pedro’s brow, when thus he heard her say;</p>
<p class="ppi2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>He sorely rued the accursed vow he had fulfilled that day;</p>
<p class="ppi2">He passed unto his paramour, where on her couch she lay.</p>
<p class="ppi2">Leaning from out her painted bower, to see the mastiff’s play.</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">He drew her to a dungeon dark, a dungeon strong and deep;</p>
<p class="ppi2">“My father’s son lies stiff and stark, and there are few to weep.</p>
<p class="ppi2">Fadrique’s blood for vengeance calls, his cry is in mine ear;</p>
<p class="ppi2">Thou art the cause, thou harlot false; in darkness lie thou here.”</p>

<p class="p1">After Pedro had alienated his people’s hearts by his
cruelty, Don Henry returned with a formidable body of
French auxiliaries. At first the fortune of the rightful
owner of the throne, who was supported by Edward the
Black Prince, prevailed, and the invader was obliged to
retire back to France: but suddenly renewing the attack,
assisted by Du Guesclin, the flower of French knighthood,
after the English auxiliaries had quitted Spain, he
defeated and took prisoner his brother. Upon entering
the chamber where he was confined, Henry exclaimed,
“Where is that whoreson and Jew, who calls himself
King of Castile?” Pedro, as proud and fearless as he
was cruel, stepped instantly forward, and replied, “Here
I stand, the lawful son and heir of Don Alphonso, and
it is thou that art but a false bastard.” The rival brothers
instantly grappled like lions; the French knights,
and Du Guesclin himself, looking on. Henry drew his
poniard, and wounded Pedro in the face, but his body
was protected by a coat of mail. A violent struggle
ensued. Henry fell across a bench, and his brother,
being uppermost, had well nigh mastered him, when one
of Henry’s followers seizing Don Pedro by the leg,
turned him over, and his master thus at length gaining
the upper hand, instantly stabbed the king to the heart.
Menard, in his history of Du Guesclin, says that, while
all around gazed like statues on the furious struggle of
the brothers, Du Guesclin exclaimed to this attendant
of Henry, “What! will you stand by, and see your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
master placed at such a pass by a false renegade? Make
forward and help him, for well you may.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>At Athens, the poets who contended for the tragic
prize, were expected to exhibit three pieces, which, from
their number, were called collectively a trilogy, together
with a fourth, satirical, drama, which came last in the
order of representation, like our farces now. Often they
chose for the argument of these tragedies different events
in the same story, so that the three formed a connected
whole: of which an instance, the only instance extant,
remains in the Agamemnon, Choephoroi, and Eumenides
of Æschylus. The tale which has just been narrated is
well fitted for this kind of representation, and would furnish
materials not unworthy even of that poet’s genius.
In the first play we may imagine an insulted queen and
deserted wife, brooding over past injuries, rejoicing in
the prospect of revenge, and urging the savage temper
of her son to seek it in the blood of those who should
have been dearest to him; the play terminating with the
death of Leonora de Guzman, and the escape of her sons,
preserved, like Orestes, to be at once the ministers of
vengeance and the instruments of further crime. For
the second the unsuspecting confidence of Don Fadrique,
his rejection of the signs and warnings, which were
offered in vain, and the successful machinations of a
wicked, perhaps a rejected woman, acting upon the proud
and cruel Pedro, are well suited; while the chorus would
find a fitting part, at first, in dark and indistinct presages
of evil, and lamentations over the blindness with which
the fated victim rushed into the snare; and at the end,
in indignant description of the circumstances of horror
narrated in the ballad, and in joining the aged nurse to
bewail the death of her foster son, and denouncing vengeance
upon the murderer’s head. The third would
contain the capture of Pedro, the mutual defiance and
death&ndash;struggle of the brothers, and the barbarous exposure
by Henry of his brother’s corpse: while at the
end the impression of these horrors might be relieved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the constant love of Maria de Padilla, who, now neglected
and despised, still watched over the forsaken body of her
monarch and lover, with a fidelity worthy of a purer
bosom.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>We reach at length the Trojan war, the point assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
by Thucydides for the commencement of his sketch of
Grecian history: a circumstance alone sufficient to discredit
the scepticism of those who believe it to be a mere fabulous
legend. The universal voice of antiquity testifies to
its reality, and we know not of any arguments strong
enough to shake this testimony. Herodotus, on the
authority of the Persians, mentions the Rape of Helen as
one of a series of reprisals consequent upon the aggression
of the Ph&oelig;nicians, who carried off Io; the cause and
commencement of hostility between the Greeks and the
Asiatic nations. The former were clearly in the wrong,
in the opinion of the Persians, both because the rape of
Helen only balanced accounts, and because the Greeks
made such injuries a ground for war. “Up to that time
they confined themselves to mutual depredations; but the
Greeks set the example of carrying war from one continent
to the other. Now, to carry off women is the act
of rogues; but to be over eager to avenge their loss is
the part of fools; and wise men will take no thought for
them after they are gone: for it is plain that they would
not have been run away with, except with their own good
will. And in truth, say the Persians, the Asiatics made
no account of the carrying off their women: but the
Greeks collected a mighty armament on account of a
Lacedæmonian female, and then came to Asia, to pull
down the empire of Priam!”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> So thought the Persians.
Herodotus confesses that he is not prepared to say how
these things took place, and sets us the example of hastening
to ground which he can tread with some certainty.
That there is no intrinsic improbability in the story, has
already been asserted by Mitford, on the ground of its
close analogy to an incident in the history of the British
islands.</p>

<p>Dermod Mac Morough (or Mac Murchad), prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Leinster, was attached to Dervorghal, wife of Tiernan
O’Ruark, another Irish chief, who held the county of
Leitrim, with some adjacent districts,&mdash;a lady of great
beauty, but small virtue, who took advantage of her
husband’s being driven into hiding by O’Connor, who
was then predominant in Ireland, to elope with her lover.
“An outrage of this kind was not always regarded with
abhorrence by the Irish; they considered it rather as an
act of pardonable gallantry, or such an offence as a reasonable
pecuniary compensation might atone for. But the
sullen and haughty prince, provoked more by the insolence
and treachery of his ravisher than the infidelity of
his wife, conceived the most determined animosity against
Dermod. He practised secretly with O’Connor, promised
the most inviolable attachment to his interest, and prevailed
on him, not only to reinstate him in his possessions,
but to revenge the insult of Mac Morough, whom he
represented, and justly, as a faithless vassal, really devoted
to the service of his rival. The King of Connaught led
his forces into Leinster, rescued Dervorghal from her
paramour, and restored her to her friends; with whom
she lived, if not in a state of reconciliation with her
husband, at least in that opulence and splendour which
enabled her to atone for the crime of infidelity, by the
usual method of magnificent donations to the church.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
This domestic squabble led to more than usually important
results, for the expelled Dermod applied to our
Henry II. for assistance, and the conquest of Ireland
followed.</p>

<p>The ambition of Agamemnon, however, is regarded by
Thucydides as the cause of the war; the abduction of
Helen served only as the pretext. “To me it seemeth
that Agamemnon got together that fleet, not so much for
that he had with him the suitors of Helena, bound thereto
by oath to Tyndareus, as for that he exceeded the rest
in power. For Atreus, after that Eurystheus was slain
by the Heraclidæ, obtained the kingdom of Mycenæ, and
whatever else had been under him, for himself. To which
greatness Agamemnon succeeding; and also far excelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the rest in shipping, took that war in hand, as I conceive
it, and assembled the said forces, not so much on favour
as by fear. For it is clear, that he himself both conferred
most ships to that action, and that some also he lent to
the Arcadians. And this is likewise confirmed by
Homer (if any think his testimony sufficient), who, at the
delivery of the sceptre unto him, calleth him, ‘Of many
isles, and of all Argos king.’”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Argos here signifies the
whole peninsula, called afterwards Peloponnesus. It is
plain, however, from Homer, that the sovereignty here
ascribed to him was of a most uncertain and insecure
tenure; that his subordinate princes were in fact independent
within their own dominions, and were too high
spirited and powerful to be maltreated with impunity.
Altogether, without the elaborate machinery of the feudal
system, the power and influence of Agamemnon seem to
have resembled that possessed by the kings of France,
and emperors of Germany, over those great vassals who
held whole provinces, and singly or united often proved
an overmatch for their sovereign.</p>

<p>Here ends the Mythic age. We shall pass over the
next three, or according to most chronologers the next
five centuries, which are but partially filled up by notices
of events, such as the return of the Heraclidæ, the
gradual subversion of monarchy throughout Greece, and
the great emigrations which peopled the Asiatic coast
with a Hellenic race. About the sixth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> we
begin to reap the benefit of contemporary authorities;
and thenceforward history, if not free from an admixture
of fiction, at least runs with a copious and uninterrupted
stream.</p>

<p class="pn">Sparta had not long acquired strength under the institutions
of Lycurgus, before she discovered that thirst of
dominion which distinguished her after&ndash;history. The
neighbouring state of Messenia was the first to suffer.
As usual, it is hard to say which party gave the first
provocation; but if the Lacedæmonians were ever in the
right, they lost that advantage when, in time of peace,
with studied secrecy they bound themselves never to
return home until Messenia was conquered; and when,
without the formality of a declaration of war, they
stormed by night Ampheia, a frontier town, and put the
unprepared inhabitants to the sword. Their enterprise
succeeded better than its iniquity merited; for after a
vigorous and protracted defence Messenia was subdued,
and continued in servitude for forty years. At the end
of that time a new race had grown up, ignorant of the
evils of war, and too high&ndash;spirited to bear their degradation
tamely. A gallant leader is seldom wanting to gallant
men engaged in a good cause; and Aristomenes
might serve as a type for all later heroes, whose exploits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
belong to the debateable ground which lies between
truth and fiction. He was a young Messenian of the
royal line, according to the report of his countrymen;
but other Greeks, with a more unbounded admiration,
related that the hero Pyrrhus,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> son of Achilles, was his
father. His valour, at least, did not disgrace his reputed
parentage; and, though daring in extremity even to desperation,
was not of that blind and foolish kind which
hurries unprepared into action, and sacrifices a good
cause to the vanity and temerity of its supporters. Before
taking the field, he secured the co&ndash;operation of Argos
and Arcadia, to support and strengthen the eager spirit
of his countrymen, and then, with a force entirely Messenian,
attacked the Lacedæmonians at a place called
Deræ. The event was doubtful; but that a conquered
people should meet its masters in battle, and part from
them on equal terms, was in itself equivalent to a victory.
Aristomenes is said to have performed deeds beyond
human prowess, and was rewarded by his grateful countrymen
with a summons to the vacant throne. He declined
the dignity, but accepted of the power under the
title of commander&ndash;in&ndash;chief.</p>

<p>His next exploit was of a singular and romantic cast,
such as would befit a knight of the court of Arthur, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Charlemagne, or the less fabulous, but scarce less romantic
era of Froissart, better than it assorts with modern notions
of a general’s or a sovereign’s duties. Considering it
important to alarm the Spartans, and impress them with
a formidable idea of his personal qualities, he traversed
Laconia, and entered Sparta by night, which, in obedience
to Lycurgus’ precepts, was unwalled and unguarded, to
suspend from the temple of Pallas a shield, inscribed
“Aristomenes from the Spartan spoils dedicates this to
the goddess.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Violence was not offered, and his object,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
therefore, must have been to win her favour, or at least
to alarm the Spartans, lest their protecting deity should
be wiled away. It is to be wished that we knew the
result of this exploit, of which, unfortunately, no account
remains. The year after the battle at Deræ, he again
led his countrymen, supported by their allies, into battle,
at a place called the Boar’s Tomb; and if upon this occasion
fortune favoured the rightful cause, it was again
mainly owing to his personal exertions. Supported by
a chosen band of eighty men, who gloried in the privilege
of risking their lives by the side of Aristomenes, he
attacked and broke in detail the choice infantry of Sparta,
committing to others the task of routing a disordered
enemy, himself ever present where they showed the
firmest front; till the Lacedæmonians forgot the precepts
of their lawgiver in a hasty flight. Their disorder was
complete, but the pursuit was early stopped, either by
the prudence of Aristomenes, or the promptitude with
which the Spartans availed themselves of local advantages.
The latter is probably the real meaning of the following
legend. There lay a wild pear&ndash;tree in the track of the
retreating army; Theoclus, the Messenian seer, warned
Aristomenes not to urge the pursuit beyond this tree, for
that Castor and Pollux, the tutelary deities of Lacedæmon,
were perched upon it. But Aristomenes thought as little
of his friend’s advice, as Hector of Polydamas’s warning
not to attack the Grecian camp, and was still hard pressing
upon the enemy, when suddenly his shield disappeared.
The loss of this weapon was esteemed disgraceful,
and therefore we can scarcely wonder that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Aristomenes, whose character stood above detraction,
should have lost time in a fruitless search, which, if improved
to the full, might have broken for ever the power
of his country’s oppressor. So great was the loss and
dismay of Sparta, that the war was kept alive with difficulty,
and that only through the influence acquired by
Tyrtæus, who devoted his poetical talents to recruiting
the courage and exasperating the hatred of the Lacedæmonians.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The history of this man is somewhat singular. At
the beginning of the war, the Lacedæmonians had been
directed by the Delphic oracle to send to Athens for an
adviser: they did so, and the city, unwilling either to
aid in the aggrandizement of a rival, or to disobey the
god, thought to extricate itself from the dilemma by
making choice of one Tyrtæus, an obscure schoolmaster,
halt of one leg, and esteemed to be of mean ability.
From the event, a Grecian would have argued in support
of the favourite doctrine, that the decrees of fate were
inevitable; for to the unknown talents of one so lightly
valued did Sparta, upon this and other occasions, owe
the favourable issue of the war.</p>

<p>But the reader may be curious to know the fate of
Aristomenes’ shield. Applying at Delphi, he was
informed that he would find it in the cave of Trophonius,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
at Lebadeia, in B&oelig;otia, where he afterwards dedicated it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
“and I myself have seen it there,”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> adds Pausanias, lest
any doubt should attach to a story which seems to border
somewhat on the marvellous. How it came there, we
are left to conjecture: and in these days of scepticism
and research, may well envy the historian whose readers’
incredulity was so easily overcome. But, with one or
two brilliant exceptions, it was sufficient for the Greeks
that a story passed current; they cared little to investigate
probabilities, or enter upon long and intricate
inquiries, which in modern times have been so successfully
employed in disentangling the mingled web of
truth and fiction. It is curious to mark the importance
attached to this miraculous loss. Aristomenes thought
it of sufficient consequence to render necessary an immediate
journey to Delphi; for we find that, returning
from Lebadeia, he renewed the war with his recovered
shield, which therefore must have been dedicated at a
later period. At first he confined himself to predatory
incursions. Returning from “driving a creagh,” in
Laconia, he was attacked and wounded, but repelled the
assailants; and, on his recovery, projected an attack
upon Sparta, which, under such a leader, might have
been fatal to an unfortified and unwatched city; but was
deterred a second time by the interposition of Castor and
Pollux. Turning aside, therefore, to Carya, he carried
off a band of Spartan maidens while engaged in a religious
ceremony; and on this occasion he showed that a life of
warfare had not deadened the kindlier feelings of his
heart, by protecting them from the drunken intemperance
of his soldiers, even to the death of some who persisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in their disobedience. The captives, according to the
custom of the age, were released upon ransom.</p>

<p>Another adventure terminated less happily, in which
he attacked a quantity of matrons employed in celebrating
the rites of Ceres, with similar views, but with a very
different result. Armed only with spits and the implements
of sacrifice, they showed the value of their Spartan
breeding, animated by religious enthusiasm, in the entire
defeat of the marauding party. Aristomenes, beaten
down with their torches, was taken prisoner. This
might have been an awkward and ill&ndash;sounding termination
to a life of lofty adventure: many a hero has fallen
victim to female wiles; but to be overcome and captured
in open war by women armed with spits and staves, is an
event not to be matched since the days of the Amazons,
either in history or romance. The usual course of events,
indeed, was inverted; for love was his deliverer from
the dangers in which valour had involved him. Archidamia,
the priestess of the goddess, who had been
previously enamoured of him, forgot her patriotism, and
set him free.</p>

<p>The Arcadians were zealous in the Messenian cause.
Unhappily their prince, Aristocrates, proved treacherous,
and took bribes from Sparta to betray his trust. “For
the Lacedæmonians gave the first example of setting
warlike prowess up to sale: prior to the transgression
of Lacedæmon, and the treason of Aristocrates, combatants
referred their cause to the arbitration of valour,
and the fortune which Providence should allot to them.
So also did they bribe the Athenian generals at Ægos&ndash;Potami:<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
but in the end the poisoned shaft recoiled upon
themselves. It was through Persian gold, distributed at
Corinth, Argos, Athens, Thebes, that the victorious
career of Lacedæmon was stopped at its height, when,
the Athenian fleet being destroyed, and a large part of
Asia delivered, Agesilaus was compelled by the disturbances
of Greece to lead home his victorious army. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
did the gods turn to their own ruin the fraud which the
Lacedæmonians had devised.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Aristocrates kept his
own counsel, until the eve of the battle of Megaletaphrus
(the great ditch), and then disseminated an opinion
among his countrymen that their position was bad, and
offered no means of retreat if they were worsted; and,
moreover, that the omens were unfavourable: finally, he
advised all to betake themselves to flight, so soon as he
should give the word. The Arcadians were steady
friends to the Messenians, yet, strange to say, they
became the abettors of their prince’s baseness, without
sharing his reward. They formed the centre and left
wing, and the consternation of the Messenians may be
imagined, when two&ndash;thirds of their army at once deserted
them. To complete his treachery, Aristocrates led the
flying troops through the Messenians, and threw them
into irretrievable confusion; forgetful of the battle, they
betook themselves to expostulation and upbraiding of their
treacherous allies; and the Lacedæmonians readily surrounded
and defeated them with such slaughter, that
from the hope of becoming lords of their former masters,
they were reduced even to despair of safety. Aristomenes
collected from all quarters the scattered remnant of his
countrymen, into one new city which he founded on
Mount Eira.</p>

<p>By this step they gave up all their territory, except
a strip along the coast held by the Pylians and Methonæans.
But they were not men to starve peaceably in
the neighbourhood of full garners,</p>

<p class="pph4 p1">For why, the good old rule<br />
Contented them; the simple plan<br />
That they should take, who have the power,<br />
And they should keep, who can:</p>

<p class="pn1">and in truth circumstances fully justified them in adopting
this simple and compendious rule of action, which they
followed with no ordinary success, carrying off corn,
wine, and cattle, equally from their own country, now
occupied by Lacedæmonians, and from Laconia; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
providing for their other wants with the ransoms paid
for men and moveables captured in their predatory excursions.
At last the Spartans found out that it was
worse than lost labour to sow, where an enemy was to
reap; and forbade the cultivation, not only of Messenia,
but even of the borders of Laconia. So great a sacrifice
bespeaks the formidable nature of the enemy, and produced
disturbances, in appeasing which the value of
Tyrtæus was again displayed. The measure was highly
politic, for it compelled the Messenians to gain their
livelihood by long and dangerous excursions. In one of
these Aristomenes, being surprised by a superior force,
was stunned by a blow, and taken, with fifty of his
comrades. Cruelty is almost the necessary consequence
of injustice; and though the Messenians, and especially
Aristomenes, seem always to have treated their prisoners
with humanity, it was resolved to insure future quiet by
sacrificing a man whose only crime was perseverance in
his country’s cause. The Spartans executed criminals
by throwing them into a deep pit, called Ceada: into
this Aristomenes and his companions were precipitated.
All, except the hero, were killed by the fall, and he,
reserved apparently for a more dreadful fate, retired to
the extremity of the cavern, and for three days sat, his
head wrapped in his cloak, in patient expectation of a
lingering and painful death. At the end of that time
he heard a slight noise, and raising his head (his eyes
by this time had become accustomed to the gloom) perceived
a fox gnawing the dead bodies. It might have
occurred to a less ready wit, that where there is an
entrance there may also be a way out; he caught the
fox, and allowing it to follow its own path without suffering
it to escape, was led along a dark passage, terminating
in a crevice just large enough to admit the
animal, through which a glimmering of light appeared.
Dismissing his guide uninjured, he enlarged the opening
with his hands, and against hope even, as well as
probability, stood once more free to vindicate his country.
It was of course supposed that a special providence, on
this as on other occasions, guarded his safety; and many,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to magnify the wonder, asserted that an eagle interposed
itself in the fall, and bore him down secure from all
harm.</p>

<p>The whole event was considered marvellous: first,
such was his lofty spirit, and renown in arms, that none
believed Aristomenes would be taken alive; but his return
from the bowels of the earth was still more amazing,
and was held to be a manifest interposition of the Deity.
The Lacedæmonians, indeed, refused to believe it, until
the total destruction of a body of Corinthians marching
to assist in the siege of Eira, “convinced them that
Aristomenes, and no other of the Messenians, had done
this.”</p>

<p>After this occurrence he performed a second time a
rite peculiar to the Messenians, called Hecatomphonia;
a sacrifice offered to the Ithomæan<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Jupiter, by such as
had slain a hundred men in battle. He had celebrated
it for the first time after the battle at the Boar’s Tomb;
the slaughter of the Corinthians gave him a second opportunity;
and he is said to have offered it yet a third
time. The Lacedæmonians now concluded a truce for
forty days, that they might go home, to celebrate one
of their great annual festivals. Aristomenes wandering
abroad without suspicion during its continuance, was
seized by seven Cretan bowmen, who, while the Spartans
were feasting, amused themselves by traversing the
country. Two of them set off to bear the news to
Sparta: the others carried him to a neighbouring village,
in which a girl dwelt, who, in a dream in the preceding
night, had seen a lion brought thither in bonds, and deprived
of claws, by wolves. She loosed it, the claws
returned, and it destroyed its captors. When Aristomenes
was brought in, and she heard his name, the interpretation
of the dream flashed across her mind. She
intoxicated the soldiers, and set him free; the treacherous
Cretans fell an easy prey. In recompence for his
life, he gave his preserver in marriage to his son Gorgus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the fortune of the war for ten years. After
the destructive battle at Megaletaphrus, in the third year,
when their cause was ruined by the defection of the Arcadians,
Aristomenes and the seer Theoclus consulted the
Delphic oracle concerning the fate of their country. The
answer ran thus&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi2 p1">When the he&ndash;goat shall bend to drink where dimpling Neda flows,</p>
<p class="ppi2">Messene’s fate draws nigh; no more can I avert her woes.</p>

<p class="p1">In the eleventh year of the siege of Eira, the fourteenth
of the war, Theoclus, while walking along the
bank of the river Neda, observed a wild fig&ndash;tree, which
in the Messenian tongue was called by the same word
which signifies a he&ndash;goat, that had grown slanting out of
the bank, and then just swept the water with its branches.
He brought Aristomenes to the place, and they agreed
that the prophecy had received its fulfilment, and the hope
of the nation was at an end. There were certain objects
preserved in secret, and invested with peculiar sanctity,
such as the Palladium enjoyed in Troy. If these were
lost, the fortune of Messenia sunk with them for ever;
if not, ancient oracles foretold that the Messenians should
again enjoy their own. Believing that the fated time had
arrived, Aristomenes buried secretly the mystic treasure
in the wildest and most desolate part of Mount Ithome;
in the persuasion that the deities, who had till then
supported them in a righteous struggle, would still watch
over the mysterious pledge of their safety.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Pausanias seems to take a malicious pleasure in observing
that Eira, no less than Troy, owed its ruin to a
woman. A herdsman, belonging to Emperamus, a
Spartan of distinction, had fled from his master, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
lived near the river Neda. He gained the affections of
a Messenian woman, who dwelt without the walls of
Eira, and used to visit her when her husband was on
guard. One night, the husband’s sudden return compelled
him to conceal himself: a storm of extraordinary
violence had caused the guard to disperse, trusting that
the inclement season would keep the Lacedæmonians
quiet, and aware that Aristomenes could not go the
rounds, according to his custom, since he was lying ill
of a recent wound. The herdsman listened to this account,
and perceived that it was a favourable opportunity
for making his peace, and even securing reward. He
hastened to Emperamus, his master, who was in command
at the camp, narrated what had happened, and conducted
the army to the assault. The way was difficult, and the
night terrible, but they surmounted these impediments,
and entered the town before the alarm was given. Taken
by surprise, its devoted inhabitants still acted up to the
reputation they had so deservedly acquired. Aristomenes
and Theoclus, aware that Messenia at length must fall,
yet concealed the fulfilment of the oracle, and roused the
courage of their comrades to desperation: even the women
showed that they preferred death to captivity, and
excited the men to higher daring by the participation of
their danger. The night passed without advantage to
either party, but at day&ndash;break the rain poured down in
still greater fury, and drove in the faces of the Messenians;
and the lightning flashing from the left, an evil
omen, at once blinded them and depressed their spirits,
while to the Spartans it came from the right, and was
welcomed as the harbinger of success. The latter too
were far superior in number; but since they could not
avail themselves of this advantage in the narrow streets,
their general sent back a part to the camp to rest and refresh
themselves, with orders to return in the evening, to
relieve that division which remained. Pressed thus continually
by fresh foes, the wretched Messenians yet protracted
the struggle. Three days and three nights they
maintained an unceasing fight; at the end of these,
watching, and cold, and wet, and thirst, and hunger, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
exhausted their strength. Then Theoclus addressed
Aristomenes: “Why do we still maintain this fruitless
labour? The decree has gone forth that Messene must
fall: that which we now see was foretold to us long since
by the priestess of Apollo, and the fig&ndash;tree lately warned
us that the time was at hand. God grants to me a common
end with my country: it is your part to preserve
the Messenians and yourself.” He rushed among the
enemy, exclaiming, “Ye shall not rejoice in the possessions
of the Messenians for ever!” and, sated with
slaughter, fell surrounded by the victims of his despair.
Aristomenes collected the survivors into a close column,
in the centre of which he placed their wives and children,
and stationing himself with his chosen band at their head,
motioned with his spear to the enemy to allow them a
free passage; which the Spartans granted, rather than
exasperate their well&ndash;tried intrepidity to frenzy. They
found a hospitable and friendly reception in Arcadia, the
inhabitants of which supplied their wants, and would willingly
have assigned to them a portion of their lands;
but the ardent spirit of Aristomenes could not brook a
quiet submission. Selecting five hundred men, the
flower of his army, he asked if they were prepared to die
with him in their country’s behalf; and having received
their hearty concurrence, proposed a scheme for surprising
Sparta, and holding it as a pledge for their own
restoration. Three hundred Arcadians volunteered to
join him; but their hopes were frustrated a second time
by the traitor Aristocrates. On this occasion, however,
he was detected, and his former villainy being at the
same time revealed, the Arcadians, in just anger, stoned
him to death. The Messenians, exhorted to join in the
punishment, looked to Aristomenes, who sat weeping,
and in imitation of their beloved leader, abstained from
sharing in a merited revenge. Tender by nature must
have been the heart of one, who, after having slain three
hundred men with his own hand, could yet weep over
the deserved punishment of an old companion in arms;
and it is pleasing to contrast the staunch patriotism of
the Messenians, still tempered by moderation and mercy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
with the savage and wanton cruelties acted by the polished
Greeks of later ages.</p>

<p>The Pylians and Methonæans, who had preserved
their navy, invited their countrymen in Arcadia to join
them, and seek a settlement in some foreign land. Aristomenes
refused to accept the proffered command; he
would never cease, he said, to war against the Lacedæmonians,
and well knew that he should ever be the cause
of some evil to them. His son Gorgus, and Manticlus,
son of Theoclus, supplied his place. Ere they had resolved
on their course, Anaxilas, prince of Rhegium,
sent to invite their co&ndash;operation in a war against the
Zanclæans, promising, in case of success, to assign to
them that wealthy city. Zancle soon fell before their
joint efforts. Anaxilas wished to slay the male citizens,
and reduce their families to slavery; but the Messenians
had learnt pity in the school of adversity, and deprecated
being made the instruments of inflicting upon others the
miseries which they themselves deplored. Interchanging
oaths of fidelity with the inhabitants, they dwelt in
union with them in the city, to which, in memory of
their beloved country, they gave the name of Messene,
which it bears to this day, under the slightly altered
form of Messina.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after their departure, Damagetus, king of
Ialysus, in Rhodes, inquiring at Delphi where he should
seek a wife, was directed to choose the daughter of the
best of the Grecians. He hesitated not to fix on Aristomenes,
and took his youngest and only unmarried child.
The warrior passed with her into Rhodes, and died soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
after, ungratified in his wish of striking another blow at
Lacedæmon. He was honoured with a splendid monument,
and worshipped as a hero in Rhodes, and by his
grateful countrymen.</p>

<p>Such of the Messenians as remained on the land were
consigned to the miserable class of Helots. But even in
this degraded state they were still a source of trouble to
their masters; and at last revolting, made so obstinate a
defence, that they obtained permission to depart unarmed,
and were settled by the Athenians at Naupactus, on the
Corinthian gulf. Two centuries after their subjection,
Epaminondas collected the scattered remnants of the
people, and re&ndash;established them in possession of their
country, in a new city, named Messene, built under his
patronage, on Mount Ithome. Thus ancient oracles
were fulfilled, the tutelary deities preserved their trust,
and the dying prophecy of Theoclus was accomplished.</p>

<p>The annals of the Norman conquest of England introduce
us to a fit companion for Aristomenes, in respect of
similarity of fortunes, as well as character. Hereward
le Wake, a youth of noble Saxon family, while yet a boy
was distinguished for strength and turbulence of character:
so rough was he in play, that his hand was against every
one, and every one’s hand against him; and so impatient
of superiority, that if the prize of wrestling, or their other
games, was awarded to another, he would assert his own
title by the cogent argument of an appeal to the sword.
His father’s love of quiet seems to have been greater than
his parental affection, for he took upon himself the task
of ridding the neighbourhood of his troublesome son, and
set forth so ably his violences against others, and certain
boyish impertinences committed against himself, that he
obtained from Edward the Confessor an order for his
banishment. Hereward went to Northumberland, and
thence travelling to Cornwall, Ireland, and Flanders, he
distinguished himself everywhere so highly, for daring,
skill in arms, and success in extricating himself from the
greatest dangers, that it was a doubt whether his courage
or his good fortune were the more admirable. His fame,
won in many a conflict, and confirmed even by the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of his enemies, was not long in reaching England; and
so entirely changed the temper of father, mother, relations,
and friends, that the worthy abbot of Croyland,
from whom our narrative is taken, can only account for
the sudden conversion of so much ill will into such violent
affection, by attributing it to the special interposition
of Providence.</p>

<p>During his abode in Flanders, he received news of the
Norman invasion, of his father’s death, and the bestowal
of his inheritance upon a Norman, who insulted and oppressed
his widowed mother. Hastening to avenge her,
he quickly expelled the spoiler; and then remembering
that he was no knight himself, though knights were now
under his command, he received the order from his uncle
the Abbot of Peterborough. For the English considered
the investiture as a religious ceremony, and whoever
underwent it confessed himself, received absolution,
and spent the eve of his consecration in prayer in the
church. In the morning, after hearing mass, he offered
his sword upon the altar; and after the gospel had been
read the priest blessed the weapon, and completed the
ceremony by laying it upon his shoulder. But the Normans,
who looked upon the order as exclusively military,
held in abomination this method of receiving it.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>A body of noble Saxons, who, like Hereward, had been
expelled from their inheritances, or driven by maltreatment
into rebellion, occupied the Isle of Ely, a tract
then environed by morasses, which now have almost disappeared,
and admirably fitted to be a place of refuge
from a more powerful but less active enemy. They
chose Hereward for their leader, and he justified their
preference and his own reputation by a series of exploits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
which continued long after to be favourite subjects of the
popular ballads; for the preservation of some of which
posterity would have owned a much greater obligation to
Ingulph, than for the minute details connected with the
monastery of Croyland, which he has thought it more
important to preserve.</p>

<p>Upon his uncle’s death the abbey of Peterborough was
bestowed by the Conqueror upon a Norman, by name
Thorold, to Hereward’s great displeasure. In conjunction
with the Danes, who then infested the eastern coast,
he resolved to disturb the temporal enjoyments at least of
the intruder. Let the Monk of Peterborough tell his
own melancholy history.</p>

<p>“Early in the morning of the above&ndash;mentioned day,
came the aforesaid evil doers, with many ships;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> but the
monks and their men shut the gates, and bestirred themselves
manfully in their defence from above, so that the
battle waxed very sore at the gate called Bulehithe.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Then Hereward and his comrades, seeing they could by
no means gain the mastery, and force entrance, set fire
to the houses near the gate, and so made passage by
burning; also, they consumed all the offices of the monks,
save the church and one house. Yet the monks met them,
and besought that they would not do this evil; but they
listened not, and went armed into the church, and would
have carried away the great crucifix, but they could not.
Nevertheless they took from its head a golden crown set
with jewels, and a stool, also made of pure gold and
jewels, from under its feet; also two golden reliquaries,
and nine made of silver, fashioned with gold and jewels,
and twelve crosses, some made of gold, others of silver,
gold, and jewels. Nor did this content them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
but they went up into the tower, and took thence a great
table made entirely of gold and gems and silver, which
the monks had hidden there, which used to stand before
the altar; and they took such a quantity of gold and silver
in articles of all sorts, books, and ornaments, as can
neither be told nor valued. All these were of the best
quality, nor did the like of them remain in England.
Yet they said that out of fealty to the church they did
thus, and that the Danes would preserve those valuables
for the use of the church, better than the Normans. And,
indeed, Hereward himself was of a monastic order, and
therefore they put some trust in him, and he afterwards
made oath that he had done this from good motives, because
he thought they should conquer King William, and themselves
possess the land.</p>

<p>“So it came to pass that nothing that was taken away
was ever restored, and the monastery, which had been so
rich, was now reduced to poverty. And from that day
nothing was ever added or restored to it, but its wealth
continually diminished. Since Abbot Thorold himself
not only added nothing, but dispersed its compact estates
among his kinsmen and the knights that came with
him.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The Abbot gave away sixty&ndash;two knights’ fees (feoda)
upon tenure of military service. Not long after, being
naturally anxious to dislodge so formidable an enemy, he
summoned his friends and vassals to drive Hereward from
the vicinity. Ivo Tailboys, a Norman baron, to whom
the Conqueror had granted the district of Hoyland, or
Holland, in Lincolnshire, still known by the latter name,
entered the woods at the head of his troops: the Abbot,
with other dignitaries, kept warily on the outside; but
while Ivo entered upon the right, Hereward darted round
upon the left, carried off the Abbot and his companions,
and made them pay a ransom of three thousand marks.
At length William in person brought a powerful army
against him, beleaguered the island closely by land and
water, and, at vast expense, proceeded to make causeways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
across the marshes, by which his position was defended.
Ivo Tailboys was a great believer in witchcraft, and he
prevailed upon the king to try its efficacy. As the
causeway proceeded, therefore, a witch was kept in advance,
in a wooden turret, to fulminate her incantations
against the enemy: but the farce soon met with a tragical
conclusion, for Hereward, watching his time when the soldiers
and workmen had gone somewhat forward, made a
circuit, and by setting fire to the reeds upon their flank,
involved soldiers, witch, and works, in one common ruin.
But the odds were overwhelming, and at last the Saxons
were compelled to submit. The other chiefs, including
some of the most noble of the land, surrendered to the
conqueror’s mercy, and suffered death, mutilation, or fine,
according to the sense entertained by him of their guilt.
Hereward alone, by his superior gallantry and conduct,
provided for the escape of his followers and himself, and
was ultimately rewarded for his valour and perseverance,
by being admitted to favour, and reinstated in his paternal
estates. He finished his days in peace, and was buried
in Croyland Abbey.</p>

<p>But British history offers another character to our notice,
who bears perhaps a nearer personal resemblance to
Aristomenes, although both his own fate and the issue of
the struggle in which he engaged were different,&mdash;Wallace,
the earliest, the stoutest, and the most fondly remembered
champion of Scottish independence: whose
name has been preserved and magnified in the recollection
of his countrymen, with an affection not inferior to
that which led the Messenians to pay divine honours to
their departed hero. The fame of both rests chiefly
upon tradition, for the earliest Scottish author who gives
the history of Wallace wrote more than a century after
his death, and the notices of his exploits in the English
chroniclers are meagre and unsatisfactory. It is impossible
therefore accurately to depict his character, or to
draw the line minutely between truth and fiction. We
see a form of commanding and colossal proportions, but
we see it dimly, and the features must be filled up from
our own imaginations: but we may at least trace indomitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
courage, constancy, and patriotism; and if these
lofty qualities were sometimes sullied by ferocity, yet, in
justification of the sympathy and interest which his career
excites, we may plead not only the character of the
age, and the sufferings endured by Scotland under the
English yoke, but the exacerbation of temper which must
necessarily arise from a life of constant hardship and danger.
Hunted continually from morass to forest, denied
the enjoyment of domestic happiness, dependent upon his
own right hand for the security which was to be found
only in the death of his pursuers, it is rather matter for regret,
than for stern censure, if in the hour of victory the
call of mercy was unheeded. And in further extenuation
we may add, that to control the excesses of his followers
does not seem always to have been in the power
even when it was in the wish of their chief; and that it
is reasonable and consistent with the bitter spirit of national
enmity which long prevailed, to conjecture that
the blind minstrel, who is his principal biographer, consulted
the passions and prejudices of his hearers no less
by exaggerating the deeds of vengeance acted by his
hero, than his hair&ndash;breadth escapes, and almost superhuman
might.</p>

<p>It is amusing to note how party spirit has biassed the
view taken of his origin and motives. The English writers
speak of him slightingly, without notice of the extraordinary
qualities ascribed to him, as a common robber,
who having by degrees collected round him a large band
of desperate men, was emboldened to attack and plunder
the suite of Ormesby, chief justiciary of Scotland. Compare
this with the account given by Bower,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in whose
eyes, it is but fair to say, the having fought stoutly in
defence of Scotland was cloak enough to cover a multitude
of offences.</p>

<p>“In the same year (1297) that famous warrior William
Wallace, the hammer and the scourge of the English,
son of a noble knight of the same name, lifted up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his head; and when he saw the affliction of his nation,
and the goods of the Scots delivered into the hands of
their enemies, his heart pined and was sore afflicted.
For he was tall of stature, gigantic in body, of calm aspect,
and cheerful countenance, broad shouldered, big
boned, proportionately corpulent, pleasant, yet stern to
behold, thick loined, powerful of limb, a most stout
champion, and very strong, and well knit in all his joints.
Moreover the Most High had so distinguished him by a
certain prepossessing mirthfulness, had so graced with some
heavenly gift both his deeds and words, that by his mere
aspect he disposed the hearts of all true Scots to love
him. And no wonder, for he was most generous, in
judgment most just, in ministering comfort most patient,
in council most wise, in sufferance most enduring, in
speech most eloquent: above all things hostile to lies and
falsehood, and abhorrent of treachery: wherefore the
Lord was with him, through whom he was in all things
prosperous, venerating the church, revering churchmen,
supporting the poor and widowed, cherishing orphans,
raising the oppressed, lying in wait for thieves and robbers,
and without reward inflicting deserved punishment
upon them.”</p>

<p>The following extract comprises such particulars of his
early career as seem entitled to historical credit. “At
this time (1297), and out of this middle class of the lesser
barons, arose an extraordinary individual, who was at first
driven into the field by intolerable injury and despair, and
who in a short period of time, in the reconquest of his native
country, developed a character which may without exaggeration
be termed heroic. This was William Wallace,
or Walays, the second son of Sir Malcolm Wallace,
of Ellersley, near Paisley, a simple knight, whose family
was ancient, but neither rich nor noble. In those days
bodily strength and knightly prowess were of the highest
consequence in commanding respect and ensuring success.
Wallace had an iron frame. His make, as he grew up to
manhood, approached almost to the gigantic, and his personal
strength was superior to the common run of even
the strongest men. His passions were hasty and violent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
a strong hatred to the English, who now insolently lorded
it over Scotland, began to show itself at a very early period
of his life; and this aversion was fostered in the
youth by an uncle, a priest, who, deploring the calamities
of his country, was never weary of extolling the
sweets of liberty and the miseries of dependence.</p>

<p>“The intrepid temper of Wallace appears first to have
shown itself in a quarrel with one of the English officers,
who insulted him. Provoked by his taunts, Wallace,
reckless of the consequences, stabbed him with his dagger,
and slew him on the spot. The consequence of this was
to him the same as to many others, who at this time preferred
a life of dangerous freedom to the indulgence and
security of submission. He was proclaimed a traitor,
banished his home, and driven to seek his safety in the
wilds and fastnesses of his country. It was here that he
collected by degrees a little band, composed at first of a
few brave men of desperate fortunes who had forsworn
their vassalage to their lords, and refused submission to
Edward, and who at first carried on that predatory warfare
against the English, to which they were impelled
as well by the desire of plunder, and the necessity of
subsistence, as by the love of liberty. These men chose
Wallace for their chief. Superior rank, for as yet none
of the nobility or barons had joined them, his uncommon
courage and personal strength, and his unconquerable
thirst of vengeance against the English, naturally influenced
their choice, and the result proved how well it
had fallen. His plans were laid with so much judgment,
that in his first attacks against straggling parties
of the English, he was generally successful; and if surprised
by unexpected numbers, his superior strength and
bravery, and the noble ardour with which he inspired his
followers, enabled them to overpower every effort which
was made against them.</p>

<p>“To him these early and desultory excursions against
the enemy were highly useful; as he became acquainted
with the strongest passes of his country, and acquired
habits of command over men of fierce and turbulent
spirits. To them the advantage was reciprocal, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
began gradually to feel an undoubting confidence in their
leader; they were accustomed to rapid marches, to endure
fatigue and privation, to be on their guard against
surprise, to feel the effects of discipline and obedience,
and by the successes which these ensured, to regard with
contempt the nation by whom they had allowed themselves
to be overcome.</p>

<p>“The consequences of these partial advantages over
the enemy were soon seen. At first few had dared to
unite themselves to so desperate a band. But confidence
came with success, and numbers flocked to the standard
of revolt. The continued oppressions of the English,
the desire of revenge, and even the romantic and perilous
nature of the undertaking recruited the ranks of Wallace,
and he was soon at the head of a great body of Scottish
exiles.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>About this time he was joined by Sir William Douglas
at the head of all his vassals. A series of brilliant
successes followed the union of their little armies: and
such was the effect produced on the public mind, that
when their united strength broke in upon the West of
Scotland, they were joined by some of the most powerful
of the Scottish nobles, among whom we find the Steward of
Scotland, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, his brother,
and Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow.</p>

<p>Such is the outset of Wallace’s career, so far as it is
matter of authentic history. His biographer, Blind
Harry, carries him through a great number of adventures
before this period; but they possess so little of interest
or poetical merit, and are written in such antiquated
language, that the reader would probably derive little
pleasure from them. They consist chiefly of rencontres
with the English soldiery; enterprising attacks upon the
strongholds scattered throughout Scotland, and the
various events of a desultory and almost predatory warfare,
in all which his knightly prowess and sagacity are
represented as compensating for inferiority in numbers,
and as extricating his followers and himself even in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
extremity of danger. The following specimens will
probably be sufficient.</p>

<p>The first relates to the surprisal of Dunbarton Castle.
Wallace, entering the town, found the captain and part
of his garrison drinking, and bragging of what they would
do if the rebel leader and his men were within reach.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">When Wallace heard the Southron made sic din,<br />
He garred all bide, and him alane went in;<br />
The lave<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> remained, to hear of their tithans,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a><br />
He saluit them with sturdy countenance.<br />
“Fellows,” he said, “sen I come last fra hame<br />
In travail I was our land, and uncouth fame.<br />
Fra south Ireland I come in this countree,<br />
The new conquest of Scotland for to see.<br />
Part of your drink, or some good would I have.”<br />
The captain then a shrewish answer him gave;<br />
“Thou seemest a Scot unlikely, us to spy;<br />
Thou may be ane of Wallace company.<br />
Contrar our king he is risen again,<br />
The land of Fife he has rademyt in playne.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a><br />
Thou sall here bide, while we wit how it be;<br />
Be thou of his, thou sall be hanged on high.”<br />
Wallace then thought it was no time to stand,<br />
His noble sword he grippit soon in hand;<br />

The Southron men full soon were brought to dead.</p>

<p class="p1">The following extract is of a more romantic character.
Wallace, being closely pursued by the English, had, in a
mingled fit of anger and suspicion, struck off the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
one of his followers, by name Fawdoun. At night, when
he and his men had taken refuge in a tower, they heard
a horn blown at hand. Two of them went out to see
what the cause might be; they did not return, and the
horn was again heard louder than before. Two more
were sent, and so, till Wallace was left alone.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">When he alane Wallace was leavit there,<br />
The awfull blast abounded mickle mair.<br />

How they were lost through his fell fantasy.</p>

<p class="p1">In the spring of 1297 his career of victory was checked
at Irvine, by the dissensions and desertion of his army;
but the cloud soon passed away, for in the autumn we find
him engaged in the siege of Dundee, from which he was
recalled by the approach of the English, under the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Wallace determined
to await the enemy on the banks of the Forth, near
Stirling, where the river could be crossed only by a
narrow and inconvenient bridge, that scarce admitted the
passage of two horsemen together. The Scottish army
consisted of forty thousand foot, and one hundred and
eighty horse; the English, of fifty thousand foot, and one
thousand horse.</p>

<p>Surrey was probably aware of the strong position occupied
by the Scots, and the danger of passing the bridge
in face of the enemy, for he despatched two friars to propose
terms to Wallace. “That robber,” says Hemingford,
“replied, ‘Tell your fellows, that we come not
hither for the benefit of peace, but are prepared for battle,
to avenge and to free our kingdom. Let them, therefore,
come up when they will, and they shall find us
ready to meet them beard to beard.’ And when these
tidings came to our men, they that were hot&ndash;headed said,
‘Let us go up against them, for these are but threats.’
But the wiser part added, ‘We may not yet advance,
until we have well reflected what counsel to pursue.’
Then said that stout knight, Sir Richard Lundy, who had
surrendered to us at Irvine,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> ‘My lords, if it shall be that
we ascend the bridge, we are dead men. For we can
only pass by two and two, and the enemy are on our
flank, and when they please, will form in line and charge
us. But not far off there is a ford where sixty men can
cross at once. Now then give me five hundred horse
and a small body of foot; and we will make a circuit in
the enemy’s rear and overthrow him: and meanwhile
you, Lord Earl, and your company will pass the bridge
in safety.’ But they would not abide by his good counsel,
saying that it was unsafe to separate. So being divided in
opinion, some cried out to pass the bridge, others the
contrary. Among whom Cressingham, the king’s
treasurer, a proud man and a child of perdition, said, ‘It
is not well, my Lord Earl, to put off this matter farther,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and to spend the king’s money in vain. Rather let us
march up, and do our devoir as we are bound.’ The earl,
therefore, being moved by his words, gave orders that
they should pass the bridge. A strange thing was it,
and very direful in its issue, that so many, and such wise
men, who knew the enemy to be at hand, should venture
on a narrow bridge, which two horsemen could hardly
pass abreast. So that, as some said, who were in that
battle, if they had filed over without bar or hindrance
from break of day till eleven o’clock, still a large part of
the rear would have remained behind. Neither was
there a fitter place in all Scotland to deliver over the
English to the Scots, or the many into the hands of the
few. The banners of the king and earl passed over, and
among the first that most valiant knight, Sir Marmaduke
Twenge. And when the enemy saw that as many as
they thought to overthrow had crossed, they ran down
the hill, and blocked up the bridge end with their spearmen;
so that from thenceforth there was neither passage
nor return, but in the attempt many were cast over the
bridge and drowned. As the Scots came down from the
mountain, Sir Marmaduke said, ‘Is it not time, my
brethren, to charge them?’ And they assented, and
spurred their horses: and in the shock some of the Scots
horsemen fell, and the others, to a man, ran away. As
our men pursued the fugitives, one said to Sir Marmaduke,
‘Sir, we are betrayed, for our comrades do not follow, and
the banners of the king and earl are not to be seen.’
Then looking back, they saw that many of our men, and
among them the standard&ndash;bearers, had fallen, and said,
‘Our way to the bridge is cut off, and we are barred from
our friends: it is better to make trial of the water, if it
be that we may pass it, than to plunge into the columns
of the enemy, and fall to no purpose. It is difficult, yea,
impossible, for us to pass through the midst of the Scots.’
Then replied that valiant knight, Sir Marmaduke, ‘Surely,
my dear friends, it shall never be said of me, that I
drowned myself for nothing. Do not ye so either, but
follow me, and I will clear a passage through them even
to the bridge.’ Then spurring his charger, he plunged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
among the enemy, and dealing blows on either side,
passed unhurt through the throng, and laid open a wide
path for his followers. For he was tall, and stout of body.
And as he fought thus valiantly, his nephew, who was
wounded, his horse being slain, shouted after him, ‘Sir,
save me.’ He replied, ‘Get up behind me.’&mdash;‘I cannot,’
he answered, ‘for my strength is gone.’ Presently his
comrade, an esquire of the same Sir Marmaduke, came
up, and descending from his horse, he placed the young
man on it, and said to his master, ‘Sir, go where you
will, I follow;’ and he followed him to the bridge, so that
both were preserved. All who remained, to the number
of one hundred horsemen, and five thousand foot,
perished, except a few who swam the river. One knight,
also, with much difficulty, passed the water upon his
barded horse.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The Earl of Surrey quitted the field as soon as he was
rejoined by Twenge, giving orders for the destruction
of the bridge. The Scots, therefore, did not cross
to pursue their success: but notwithstanding, quantities
of plunder fell into their hands, and the decisive nature
of the defeat is evident from the consequences which
attended it. In the words of Knighton, “This awful
beginning of hostilities roused the spirit of Scotland, and
sunk the hearts of the English.” In a short time not a
fortress of Scotland remained in Edward’s possession.
The castles of Edinburgh and Roxburgh were dismantled,
and Berwick, being abandoned by the English upon the
advance of the Scots, was occupied by Wallace, who
resolved on an immediate expedition into England, with
the view of providing sustenance for his troops, and
lightening the horrors of famine, which now fell severely
upon Scotland.</p>

<p>“After that ill&ndash;omened beginning,” Hemingford continues,
“the Scots were animated, and the hearts of
the English troubled. Wallace overran and devastated
the whole of Northumberland. In that time the praise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of God ceased to be heard in all monasteries and churches
from Newcastle&ndash;upon&ndash;Tyne to Carlisle. For all monks,
canons, and other priests, with all the commons, fled
before the face of the Scots.” Turning then westward,
he passed Carlisle, which refused to surrender, ravaged
Cumberland, and was advancing into Durham, when his
progress was stopped by the winter’s setting in with
unusual severity: a deliverance ascribed to the miraculous
assistance of Cuthbert, the patron saint of the diocese.
“Returning to Hexham, where stood a wealthy
monastery, which the Scots had plundered on their advance,
three canons of that house, who, having no fear
of death, had just returned, fled into an oratory which
they had rebuilt, that, if it were the Divine will, they
might there be offered as a sacrifice of sweet savour.
Presently the spearmen came in and shook their lances
over them, saying, ‘Show us the treasures of your church,
or ye shall instantly die.’ One of them replied, ‘It is
not long since you and your people carried off our property,
as if it had been your own, and you know where
you have placed it. Since then we have sought out a
few things, as you now see.’ Meanwhile Wallace appeared
and rebuked his men, and bid them give way,
and asked one of the monks to celebrate mass, which
was done. And at the moment of elevating the host,
Wallace went forth to lay aside his armour; and then,
when the priest was about to take the holy sacrament,
the Scots gathered round him, to snatch away the cup.
And after Wallace had washed his hands, and returned
from the sacristy to the altar, he found the chalice and
the napkins, and other ornaments of the altar, carried
off; even the book in which the mass had been begun,
was gone. And while the priest was hesitating what
he should do, Wallace returned, and seeing what had
passed, he gave order that those sacrilegious men should
be sought out, and put to death. But they were not
found, inasmuch as they were not sought for in earnest.
And he said to the canons, ‘Go not away from me, but
keep near me, as you value your safety. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
people is ill&ndash;disposed, and may neither be excused nor
punished.’”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Soon after his return from this expedition, he was
elected governor of Scotland, and his measures in this
high office appear to have been judicious and temperate.
But the haughty barons could not bear the superiority
of one whose only claim was in his merit, and thus
division was sown in the Scottish councils at the time
when unanimity was more than ever needed. In the
summer of 1298 Edward himself invaded Scotland at
the head of a powerful army. The plan adopted by
Wallace upon this occasion was the same as that which
was afterwards so successfully executed by Bruce. He
avoided a general battle, which with an army far inferior
to the English must have been fought to a disadvantage,&mdash;he
fell back slowly before the enemy, leaving some
garrisons in the most important castles, driving off all supplies,
wasting the country through which the English
were to march, and waiting till the scarcity of provisions
compelled them to retreat, and gave him a favourable

<p>They advanced unopposed, therefore, but found an
inhospitable desert; and Edward, unable to replace his
exhausted stores, was at length compelled to issue orders
for a retreat to Edinburgh, hoping to meet his fleet at
Leith, and then to recommence offensive warfare. At
this critical juncture, when the military skill and wisdom
of the dispositions made by Wallace became apparent,
and when the moment to harass and destroy the invading
army in its retreat had arrived, the treachery of her nobles
again betrayed Scotland to the enemy. Two Scottish
lords, Patrick, Earl of Dunbar, and the Earl of Angus,
at day&ndash;break privately sought the quarters of the Bishop
of Durham, and informed him that the Scots were encamped
not far off in the forest of Falkirk. The Scottish
earls, who dreaded the resentment of Edward on
account of their late renunciation of allegiance, did not
venture to seek the king in person. They sent their
intelligence by a page, and added, that having heard of
his projected retreat, it was the intention of Wallace to
surprise him by a night attack. Edward, on hearing
this welcome news, could not conceal his joy. “Thanks
be to God,” he exclaimed, “who hitherto hath extricated
me from every danger. They shall not need to follow
me, since I shall forthwith go and meet them.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The consequence of this treachery was the fatal battle
of Falkirk, in which the Scots were totally defeated,
with vast slaughter, owing to the jealousy and dissensions
of the nobility; and Wallace, finding his own exertions
thwarted, resigned his office.</p>

<p class="p1">For several years after this, we do not meet with his
name in the records of authentic history. The blind
minstrel transports him to France during this period,
where he goes through many adventures, and, among
others, kills a lion in single combat. But we must
hasten to the closing scene of his life. After Edward
had overrun and subjected the whole country in 1303,
all others who had distinguished themselves in the war
were admitted to pardon upon terms more or less hard.
“As for William Wallace,” says the deed, “it is
covenanted, that if he thinks proper to surrender himself,
it must be unconditionally to the will and mercy of our
lord the king.” To accept such terms was to deliver
himself over to death; he therefore betook himself to the
woods and mountains, and lived upon plunder.</p>

<p>It is amusing to trace the effects of national partiality
in the contradictory accounts of the Scottish and English
historians. Bower tells us that Wallace’s friends
endeavoured to induce him to submit, upon the same
terms as themselves; and that Edward was so anxious
upon this head, that he offered, not only personal security,
but an earldom, with ample domains, to be
selected by himself, either in Scotland or England, as
the price of his allegiance. But Wallace answered, that
if every other Scot should submit, still he and his companions
would stand up for the freedom of the kingdom;
and never, as they hoped for God’s favour, obey any one
except their monarch or his deputy. Langtoft, on the
other hand, says that the Scottish hero offered to surrender
upon assurance of safety in life, limb, and estate;
but Edward’s anger was so hot against him, that he
burst into a fury at the bare proposition.</p>

<p class="pr4"><i>Langtoft’s Chronicle of Edw. I.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“The day after his arrival at London, he was brought
on horseback to Westminster, the mayor, sheriffs, and
aldermen, and many others, both on foot and horseback,
accompanying him; and in the greate hall at Westminster,
he being placed upon the south bench, crowned
with laurel, for that he had said in times past, that he
ought to bear a crowne in that Hall (as it was commonly
reported), and being appeached for a traytor by
Sir Peter Mallorie, the king’s justice, hee answered,
that he never was traytor to the king of England, but
for other things whereof he was accused, he confessed
them, and was after headed and quartered.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>His head was set up at London, his quarters were sent
to Newcastle, Berwick, Perth, and Aberdeen. But
Edward reaped no advantage from this act of cruelty and
injustice, except the gratification of his implacable temper.
If intimidation was his object, it failed, as was to
be expected in the case of a high&ndash;spirited people: and
the only effect of raising these ghastly trophies was to
inspire a deeper hatred of the tyrant who commanded
them, and of the treacherous minister of his revenge.
The latter long continued to be an object of especial
hatred to the Scottish nation; and is condemned to shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in its traditional literature under the fitting title of the
“false Menteith.”</p>

<p>Here, it might be supposed, history must end, and the
ultimate destiny of the oppressor and oppressed, the
tyrant and his victim, remain a mystery until the time
when all things shall be brought to light. But the patriotic
chronicler before quoted, who probably could not
bear that the last scene of his hero should be one of
suffering and degradation, undertakes to enlighten our
curiosity on this subject. We read in the continuation
of Fordun by Bower, that, according to the testimony of
many credible Englishmen, “an holy hermit, being rapt
in the spirit, saw innumerable souls delivered from purgatory
marshalling the way, while the spirit of Wallace
was conducted to heaven by angels, in reward of his inflexible
patriotism. To whom the proverb may be
applied, ‘The memory of the just with praise, and the
name of the wicked stinketh.’”</p>

<p>Soon after, he proceeds to illustrate the latter clause
of the proverb. When Edward died upon his march to
Scotland, an English knight, Bannister by name, upon
the night of his decease, saw in a trance his lord the
king, surrounded by a multitude of devils, who were
mocking him with much laughter, and saying,</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">En rex Edwardus, debacchans ut leopardus!<br />
Olim dum vixit populum Dei maleflixit.<br />
Nobis viæ talis comes ibis, care sodalis,<br />
Quo condemneris, ut dæmonibus socieris.<br />
Te sequimur voto prorsus torpore remoto.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">Meanwhile they drove him on with whips and scorpions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
“Let us sing,” they said, “the canticle of death, beseeming
this wicked soul; because she is the daughter of death,
and food of fire unquenchable; the friend of darkness,
and enemy of light.” And then they repeated <i>En rex</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>While thus tormented by the evil spirits, he turned,
said the knight, his trembling and bloodless visage
towards me, as if to implore the aid which I was used
to minister to him. But when voice and sense both
deserted me, he cast upon me such a dreadful look, that
while I live and remember it I can never more be cheerful.
With that, he was in a moment swallowed up into
the infernal pit, exclaiming in a doleful voice,</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">Heu cur peccavi? fallor quia non bene cavi.<br />
Heu cur peccavi? perit et nihil est quod amavi.<br />
Heu cur peccavi? video, quia littus aravi,<br />
Cum sudore gravi mihimet tormenta paravi.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Bannister was so terrified by this vision, that he forsook
the world and its vanities, and, for the improvement
of his life and conversation, spent his latter days in
solitude.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Scotland did not long languish in want of a deliverer.
The place of Wallace was quickly filled up by one
scarce his inferior in knightly renown, or in the affections
of his countrymen. Were it not for the length of this
article, we should willingly narrate some of the exploits
and hair&ndash;breadth escapes which procured for Robert
Bruce, even among the English, the reputation of being
the third best knight in Europe; but we must hasten to
conclude with the panegyric of the affectionate Bower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is no living man who is able to narrate the
story of those complicated misfortunes which befell him
in the commencement of this war; his frequent perils,
his retreats, the care and weariness, the hunger and
thirst, the watching and fasting, the cold and nakedness,
to which he exposed his person, the exile into which he
was driven, the snares and ambushes which he escaped,
the seizure, imprisonment, execution, and utter destruction
of his dearest friends and relatives. And if, in
addition to these almost innumerable and untoward events,
which he ever bore with a cheerful and unconquered
spirit, any man should undertake to describe his individual
conflicts, and personal successes, those courageous
and single&ndash;handed combats in which, by the favour of
God, and his own great strength and courage, he would
often penetrate into the thickest of the enemy,&mdash;now
becoming the assailant, and cutting down all who opposed
him; at another time acting on the defensive, and
evincing equal talents in escaping from what seemed
inevitable death;&mdash;if any writer shall do this, he will
prove, if I am not mistaken, that he had no equal in his
own time, either in knightly prowess, or in strength and
vigour of body.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">Treatment of Prisoners of War&mdash;Cr&oelig;sus&mdash;Roman Triumphs&mdash;Sapor
and Valerian&mdash;Imprisonment of Bajazet&mdash;His
treatment of the Marshal Boucicaut and his Companions&mdash;Changes
produced by the advance of Civilization&mdash;Effect
of Feudal Institutions&mdash;Anecdote from Froissart&mdash;Conduct
of the Black Prince towards the Constable Du Guesclin
and the King of France.</p>

<p class="pn">The wealth of Cr&oelig;sus is proverbial, and the vicissitudes
of his fortune have been a favourite subject for moralists
in all ages. In Mitford’s History of Greece, as well as
in that published in the Library of Useful Knowledge,
all notice of them is confined to the simple statement,
that he was conquered by Cyrus. The circumstances of
his treatment, however, as they are related by Herodotus,
are curious; and we propose, therefore, to translate them
literally from that author, leaving it to the reader’s discretion
to reject whatever is evidently fabulous.</p>

<p>It is well known that he was induced to make war
upon Cyrus by an ambiguous response of the Delphic
oracle, which predicted to him, “that if he made war
upon the Persians, he would destroy a great empire.”
The oracle was a very safe one. Cr&oelig;sus understood it,
that the Persian empire would be destroyed; but the
credit of the god was equally supported by the event
which really took place, the defeat of Cr&oelig;sus and the
destruction of his kingdom. Upon his defeat he took
refuge in Sardis, which was besieged and ultimately
stormed. “So the Persians captured Sardis and took
Cr&oelig;sus alive, after he had reigned fourteen years; and
led him before Cyrus, who caused a mighty funeral pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to be built, upon which he set Cr&oelig;sus in fetters, and
with him fourteen Lydian youths; whether it were in
his mind to offer them to some deity as the first&ndash;fruits
of his conquest, or with intention to perform some vow,
or because he had heard of Cr&oelig;sus’s piety and therefore
set him upon the pile, that he might know whether any
god would deliver him from being burnt alive. Howbeit,
he did so: but while Cr&oelig;sus stood upon the pile, it
struck him, even in this extremity of evil, that Solon
was inspired when he said that no man ought to be
called happy while he was yet alive.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> And when this
thought occurred to him, after being long silent, he
thrice repeated with groans the name of Solon. Cyrus
heard him, and bade the interpreters ask who this Solon,
whom he invoked, might be; and they drew near, and
did so. But Cr&oelig;sus spoke not for some time, and
replied at length, when he was compelled, ‘One whom
I would rather than much wealth, were introduced to
the conversation of all monarchs.’ But as he spoke
unintelligibly to them, they again asked what he meant;
and when they became urgent and troublesome, he
related at length how Solon, an Athenian, came to him,
and having beheld all his treasures, set them at nought,
having spoken to such purpose, that all things had happened
according to his words, which yet bore no especial
reference to himself more than to the rest of mankind,
particularly to those who trusted in their own good
fortune. So by the time Cr&oelig;sus had given this account,
the pile being lighted, the outside of it was in flames.
And when Cyrus heard from the interpreters what
Cr&oelig;sus said, he repented, and reflected that he, being but
a man himself, was casting another alive into the flames
who formerly had been no whit inferior to himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
prosperity: and being also in dread of divine vengeance,
and considering that nothing human is unchangeable, he
ordered the fire to be forthwith extinguished, and Cr&oelig;sus,
with his companions, to be taken down; but his officers,
with all their endeavours, were unable to master it. Then
Cr&oelig;sus, as the Lydians say, discovering that Cyrus had
changed his purpose, when he saw that all were endeavouring,
and yet were unable to quench the fire, called
loudly upon Apollo, entreating the god, if that he ever
had offered any acceptable gifts, now to stand by, and
deliver him from the present evil. And as he called
upon the god in tears, suddenly clouds collected in the
serene sky, and the storm broke down, and a torrent of
rain fell, and extinguished the fire. Cyrus, therefore,
being by these means instructed that Cr&oelig;sus was a good
man, and beloved by the gods, inquired of him, when he
was come down from the pile, ‘Cr&oelig;sus, who persuaded
you to invade my kingdom, and thus become an enemy
instead of a friend?’ And he said, ‘O king, I have
done thus to further your good, and my own evil fate:
but the god of the Grecians, who puffed me up to war,
has been the author of these events. For no man is so
witless as to choose war instead of peace, when, in the
one, fathers bury their sons, and in the other, sons their
fathers. But it was the pleasure of the gods that these
things should turn out thus.’</p>

<p>“Thus spoke Cr&oelig;sus, and Cyrus released him, and
kept him near his person, and thenceforth treated him
with much respect.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The evident intermixture of fable with this tale is
calculated to throw doubt upon the whole of it, and
indeed it seems at variance with the character of Cyrus.
That Xenophon omits all mention of the circumstances
related would be a strong argument in disproof of them,
if they were calculated to advance his hero’s reputation;
but in the present case his silence is of little weight.
The close resemblance, however, between the preservation
of Cr&oelig;sus, and the miraculous deliverance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Jewish youths condemned by Nebuchadnezzar to the
furnace, might warrant us in suspecting that some account
of so impressive a display of Divine power had reached
the western coast of Asia, and that the careless or unfaithful
annalists of those early times transferred the
scene from Babylon to Lydia, and substituted the names
best known in their own history for the barbarian appellations
of the Assyrian monarch and his prisoners.
This idea may be supported by the expression of Herodotus,
that Cyrus condemned Cr&oelig;sus to be burnt
“because of his piety, that he might know whether any
god would deliver him from being burnt alive.” Cyrus
was neither cruel nor a scoffer, so that we cannot suppose
it to have been an impious jest, and can as little
imagine that it was a serious experiment on the part of
the Persian to try the power of the Grecian deities. It
is not very likely, therefore, that such a reason was invented
to account for the action; but the recorded
preservation of the Jews, and the decree of Nebuchadnezzar
“that there is no other god that can deliver after
this sort,” may well enough have led to the inference that
the monarch’s object was to prove the power which in
the end he was obliged to confess.</p>

<p>No extraordinary quantity either of humanity or
reflection was necessary to have impressed on Cyrus’s
mind, in the first instance, the truths contained in Solon’s
warning to his rival. But humanity towards prisoners
was no virtue of antiquity; and in this respect the practice
of European nations of modern times offers a striking
contrast to that of heathenism in all ages and regions.
Our Scandinavian ancestors and the North American
Indians put prisoners to death for revenge, or for the
mere pleasure of inflicting pain: the rude Druids and
the comparatively polished priests of Mexico alike esteemed
an enemy’s blood the most grateful offering to
their savage deities. The histories of Greece and Rome
abound also with acts of atrocious cruelty; while the
East is notorious alike for the frequent changes of
her dynasties, and for the unsparing policy which
has prompted successive conquerors to establish their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
own thrones by the extermination of all possible claimants.</p>

<p>It is not fair, however, to select none but unfavourable
examples; and of favourable ones, few or none are more
celebrated than the generosity of Alexander and the
virtue of Scipio. After Alexander had gained the important
battle of Issus (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 333), in the Persian war,
Darius’s family fell into the victor’s hands.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> They were
treated with the respect due to their rank and their
misfortunes. “Not long after, one of his queen’s
eunuchs escaped to Darius, who, when he saw him,
first asked whether his children and his wife and
mother were alive. And hearing that they were so,
that they were addressed as queens, and enjoyed all the
respect and attention which they had possessed at his
own court, he inquired in addition, whether his wife
had preserved her faith; and being satisfied on this
point also, he again inquired whether any insult or violence
had been offered to her. The eunuch affirmed
with an oath, ‘O king, your wife remains even as you
left her, and Alexander is the best and most temperate
of men.’ Upon which Darius lifted up his hands towards
heaven, and prayed, ‘O sovereign Jupiter, in whose
hands are placed the fortunes of kings upon earth, above
all things do thou maintain the kingdom of the Medes
and Persians, which thou hast given to me! But if thou
wilt that I be king of Asia no longer, then intrust my
power to none but Alexander.’”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Closely akin to this in all its circumstances is the
celebrated story of the continence of Scipio, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
obtained immortal praise by surrendering untouched to
her lover a beautiful Spanish lady who had been selected
from the other prisoners and presented to him; and
from the admiration testified by all antiquity for the
virtue displayed alike by the Grecian and the Roman
hero, we may form an opinion of the treatment which
captives generally endured. We have no wish to
detract from the praise which is justly due to them, or
to undervalue the merit of those who precede their age
in humanity and refinement; but it is worthy of observation
that in modern times, far from such conduct being
regarded as an effort of virtue almost super&ndash;human, infamy
or death would be the portion of a general who
acted otherwise. These exceptions therefore do really
serve to confirm the rule; and the extravagant commendation
which has been bestowed upon such self&ndash;denial
bears incontrovertible evidence to the general
want of generosity in conquerors, and to the unhappy
condition of the conquered.</p>

<p>Few foreigners of regal dignity or exalted fortune
fell into the power of the Grecian commonwealths: of
their treatment of each other’s citizens we shall have
occasion to speak hereafter. But the gigantic grasp of
Roman ambition comprehended the most powerful of
the earth, and made them drink deep of degradation.
The usual lot of prisoners of war was slavery; a practice
bad enough, but common to the rest of antiquity with
Rome: the institution of triumphs is her peculiar glory
and distinction. Something may be said in palliation of
a victor, who, having possession of his enemy, obviates
the danger of further resistance or revolt by committing
him to that narrow prison from which alone there is no
chance of escape. But when a Roman general’s arms
were crowned with success, the prisoners of highest
estimation were carefully reserved; and when all danger
from their life was at an end, and their degradation, as
far as external circumstances can degrade, was complete,
after they had been led in chains before their conqueror’s
car, to swell his vanity and satiate the pride of Rome,
they were sent to perish unheeded and unlamented by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the hands of the executioner, and the thanksgiving due
to the gods and the triumphal banquet were delayed
until the savage ritual was duly performed. “Those
even who triumph, and therefore grant longer life to the
hostile chiefs, that from their presence in the procession
the Roman people may derive its fairest spectacle and
fruit of victory, yet bid them to be led to prison when
they begin to turn their chariots from the Forum to the
Capitol; and the same day puts an end to the conqueror’s
command and to the life of the conquered.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> They led
the prisoners to execution at the moment when the
triumphal chariot began to ascend the Capitoline hill, in
order, they said, that their moment of highest exultation
might be that of their enemies’ extremest agony. There
is a needless barbarity and insolence in the whole proceeding
which is peculiarly disgusting; and which was
aggravated by the solemn hypocrisy of placing in the
triumphal chariot a slave to whisper in the victor’s ear,
“Remember that thou art a man,” when in the same
instant they displayed so signal a disregard for the reverses
to which humanity is exposed, and such contempt
for the lessons which that warning ought to have
taught.</p>

<p>We may take as an example the treatment of Jugurtha,
king of Numidia; for whom, indeed, so far as his
own merits are concerned, no treatment could have been
too severe. “Marius, bringing home his army againe
out of Lybia into Italy, took possession of his consulship
the first day of January, and therewithall made his triumph
into the city of Rome, shewing that to the Romans
which they thought never to have seen; and that was,
king Jugurth prisoner, who was so subtill a man, and
could so well frame himself unto his fortune, and with his
craft and subtilty was of so great courage besides,
that none of his enemies ever hoped to have had
him alive. But it is said that after he was led in this
triumph, he fell mad straight upon it; and the pompe of
triumph being ended, he was carried unto prison, where
the serjeants, for hast to have the spoil of him, tore his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
apparel by force from off his back: and because they
would take away his rich gold earrings, that hung on his
eares, they pulled away with them the tippe of his eare,
and then cast him naked to the bottome of a deep dungeon,
his wits being altogether troubled, Yet when they
did throw him downe, laughing he said, ‘O Hercules,
how cold are your baths!’ He lived there yet six days,
fighting with hunger, and desiring alwaies to prolong his
miserable life to the last hour: the which was a just deserved
punishment for his wicked life.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Marius, however, with all his military talents was but
a rude and blood&ndash;thirsty soldier. From Cæsar, on the
contrary, who throughout the civil wars displayed signal
generosity and mildness of temper, we might have expected
a fairer estimate of the treatment due to a noble
enemy. But in his treatment of Vercingetorix those
noble qualities are exchanged for the haughty and selfish
cruelty which the foreign policy of Rome was most
admirably calculated to produce. That prince, after a
most gallant and almost successful stand in defence of
the liberties of Gaul, being shut up in Alesia, and reduced
to extremity by Cæsar, surrendered himself to
the victor’s mercy in hope of obtaining better terms for
his comrades. The scene is thus described by Dion
Cassius:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Vercingetorix being still at liberty, and unwounded,
might have escaped; but hoping, for the sake of their
previous friendship, to obtain forgiveness from Cæsar, he
went out to him without notice of his coming. And while
the Roman general was seated on the tribunal, he appeared
suddenly, so as to alarm some persons, for he was
tall of stature, and made a gallant appearance in his armour.
All around being hushed, he said nothing, but
fell on his knee, stretching out his hand in gesture of
supplication. All others were struck with compassion,
both by the recollection of his former high state, and by
the exceeding piteousness of the spectacle before them.
But Cæsar made that from which he chiefly expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to derive safety, the heaviest charge against him; for,
dwelling on the return for his friendship, he made the
injury appear the heavier. And therefore he pitied him
not in that conjuncture, but for the present cast him into
bonds, reserving him until his triumph, after which he
slew him.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>But Rome, which had so often insulted the majesty of
fallen royalty, endured in the person of one of her emperors
a greater degradation than any which she had inflicted.
When the emperor Valerian was taken prisoner
by Sapor, king of Persia, his life was spared, but spared
that his age might waste in the most humiliating slavery;
and when the haughty monarch mounted his horse, he
used the prostrate body of his royal captive for a footstool.
That, said the haughty Sapor, was a real triumph; not
painting imaginary processions upon walls, as the Romans
did. To gratify the victor’s pride still more, he was compelled
to wear the imperial purple and decorations, and
in this attire, laden with chains, he followed in the train
of Sapor, and exhibited to the whole Persian empire a
striking picture of the fallen pride of Rome. This system
of insult extended even beyond the grave: his skin is related
to have been dyed scarlet, and stuffed, and then
placed in a temple as an enduring monument of the shame
of Rome. The Christian writers, who alone relate all
the particulars of Valerian’s humiliation,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> see in it the
just vengeance of God for his persecution of our faith:
the reason, probably, that Gibbon seems inclined to
consider the story as a pious fiction. If so, however, it
soon obtained currency, for the Emperor Constantine,
who flourished not much more than half a century after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the event, alludes to it in a letter to the king of Persia:
“All these emperors (the persecutors of Christianity)
have been destroyed by such a dreadful and avenging
end, that since their times all mankind doth usually wish
their calamities may fall as a curse and punishment upon
those who shall study to imitate them. One of which
persons I judge him to have been (him, I mean, whom
divine vengeance like a thunderbolt drove out of our
regions, and conveyed unto your country) who by his
own disgrace and ignominy erected that trophy so much
boasted of among you.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Somewhat similar to the indignities offered to Valerian
was the treatment which the Sultan Bajazet is said to
have experienced from Tamerlane after his defeat and
capture.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">Closed in a cage, like some destructive beast,<br />
I’ll have thee borne about in public view;<br />

<p class="p1">Voltaire and other modern writers have discredited
this story, chiefly on the authority of D’Herbelot. It
has been shown, however, by Sir W. Jones, that the
premises of that distinguished orientalist are false, and
his authority therefore falls to the ground. On the other
hand, Leunclavius, in his History of the Turks, professes
to have heard from an old man, who was in Bajazet’s
service at the time of his defeat, “that an iron cage was
made by Timour’s command, composed on every side of
iron gratings, through which he could be seen in any
direction. He travelled in this den slung between two
horses. Whenever Timour and his retinue, on moving
his camp, made ready for a journey, he was usually
carried before; and after the march, when they dismounted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
he was placed upon the ground in his cage,
before Timour’s tent.” Poggio also, himself a contemporary,
mentions this strange imprisonment as an undoubted
fact.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The English reader will find some countenance for
the story in Edward the First’s inhuman treatment of
the Countess of Buchan. That lady having dared, it
is said, in virtue of hereditary privileges, to place the
crown of Scotland on the Bruce’s head, and afterwards
falling into the English monarch’s hands, was confined
in a cage built upon one of the towers of Berwick Castle,
exposed, as it should seem, to the rigour of the elements
and the gaze of passers by. One of Bruce’s sisters was
similarly dealt with. So much for the devoted respect
paid to women in the age of chivalry, and that by a
prince who, when young, was inferior to none in knightly
renown. But the demoralizing effects of absolute power
found a fitting subject to work upon in Edward’s stern
and unforgiving temper. The original order for the
Countess’s confinement is to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ordered and commanded, by letters under the privy
seal, to the Chamberlain of Scotland, or his deputy at
Berwick&ndash;upon&ndash;Tweed, that in one of the turrets, upon
the castle of that place, in such place as he shall chuse,
and shall be most convenient, he do make a cage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
strong lattice&ndash;work and bars, and well strengthened with
iron&ndash;work, in the which he shall place the Countess of
Buchan.</p>

<p>“And that he shall so well and surely guard her in
the same cage, that in no manner shall she pass out
from it.</p>

<p>“And that he do appoint one or two English women
of the said town of Berwick who shall be in no wise
suspected, who understand to serve the said Countess with
meat and drink, and all things pertaining to her.</p>

<p>“And that he do so well and strictly guard her in
the cage, that she speak to none, and that no man
or woman of the Scotch nation, nor any other appear
before her, but only the woman or women who shall
be assigned her, and those who shall have guard of
her.</p>

<p>“And that the cage be so made, that the Countess
may have there the convenience of a fair chamber, but
that it be so well and surely ordered, that no danger
may betide in respect of the custody of the said Countess.</p>

<p>“And that he who has care of her be charged to
answer for her, body for body, and that he be allowed
her expenses.</p>

<p>“In like manner it is ordered that Mary, sister of
Robert Bruce, sometime Earl of Carrick, be sent to
Roxburgh, to be kept there in the castle, in a cage.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The reader will not sympathise much with the harshness
of Bajazet’s durance, if he knows the character of
that redoubtable conqueror. The following passage will
convey a fair idea of it, and presents a good specimen of
the style of the 15th century:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the year 1396, Sigismond, King of Hungry, sent
sweet and amyable letters to the French king by a notable
ambassador, a bysshop and two knights of Hungry. In
the same letters was contayned a greate parte of the
state and doyng of the greate Turke (Bajazet), and how
that he had sent worde to the King of Hungry, that he
would come and fight with him in the middes of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
realme, and would go fro thens to the cytie of Rome,
and would make his horse to eate otes upon the high altar
of Saynt Peter, and there to hold his see imperiale.
Thus the King of Hungry in his letters prayed the
French king to ayde and succour him.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In consequence
of this application, a strong body of French and other
knights marched into Hungary, under command of John
of Burgundy, Earl of Nevers. They crossed the Danube,
and after a successful campaign were besieging Nicopolis
in union with the Hungarian forces, when Bajazet marched
to the relief of that city. The loss of the battle which
ensued is attributed by Froissart to the precipitance of
the French knights, who led the van, and rushed madly
into combat, against the order of the King of Hungary,
and without waiting for his support. The biographer of
the Marshal Boucicaut, on the other hand, throws the
whole blame upon the cowardly desertion of the Hungarians.
However this may be, the French charged in a
body not exceeding 700 men,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> routed the first body of
Bajazet’s cavalry, and penetrated through a line of stakes,
behind which the infantry were formed. “Then the
noble Frenchmen, like men already enraged at the loss
which they had endured, ran upon them with such valour
and hardihood that they frightened all. I may not say
how they laid upon them. For never did foaming boar,
or angry wolf, shew a fiercer recklessness of life. There
the valiant Marshal of France, Boucicaut, among other
brave men, thrust himself into the thickest press, and
well proved whether he were grieved or no. For there
without fail did he so many acts of arms, that all marvelled,
and there bore himself so knightly, that whoso
saw him still avers there never was any man, knight or
other, seen to do in one day more brave and valiant acts
than he did then.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The Earl of Nevers, the Lord of
Coucy, and the other French nobility well approved
their valour; but Boucicaut, if we may trust his biographer,
was the hero of the day. Mounted on a powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
war&ndash;horse, he spurred forwards, and struck so fiercely
to the right and to the left that he overthrew everything
before him. “And ever doing thus, he advanced so far,
which is a marvellous thing to relate, and yet true, as all
who saw it can bear witness, that he cut through the
whole Saracen array, and then returned back through
them to his comrades. Heaven, what a knight! God
protect his valour! Pity will it be when life shall fail
him! But it will not be so yet, for God will protect
him. Thus fought our countrymen as long as their
strength lasted. Ah, what pity for so noble a company,
approved so gentle, so chivalrous, so excellent in arms,
which could have succour from no quarter, so ran they in
to their enemies’ throats, so as is the iron on the anvil!<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
For they were surrounded and oppressed so fatally on all
sides that they could no longer resist. And what wonder?
for there were more than twenty Saracens against
one Christian! And yet our people killed more than
20,000 of them, but at last they could exert themselves
no more. Ah, what a misfortune, what pity! Ought not
those disloyal Christians to have been hanged who thus
falsely abandoned them? Shame fall upon them, for had
they helped the valiant French and their comrades with
good will, not Bajazet nor one of his Turks would have
escaped death or captivity, which would have been a
mighty good to all Christendom.</p>

<p>“Great pity was there again the morrow of this dolorous
battle. For Bajazet, sitting within a tent in the midst
of the field, caused to be led before him the Earl of Nevers
and those of his lineage, with all the French barons,
knights, and esquires who remained after the slaughter
of that field. Sad was it to see these noble youths, in
the prime of life, of blood so lofty as that of the royal
line of France, fast bound with ropes, disarmed, in their
under doublets, conducted by these ugly, frightful dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of Saracens before the tyrant enemy of the faith who sat
there. He knew for certain, through good interpreters,
that the Earl of Nevers was grandson and cousin&ndash;german
to a king of France, and that his father was a duke of
great power and wealth, and that others were of the
same blood and nearly related to the king. So he bethought
himself, that for preserving them he might have
great treasure: therefore he did not put them to death,
nor any other of the greatest barons, but made them sit
there on the ground before him. Alas! immediately
after began the cruel sacrifice. For then were led before
him the noble Christian barons, knights, and esquires,
naked; and then, as they paint on the walls King Herod
sitting on a chair, and the Innocents cut in pieces before
him, there were our faithful Christians cut in pieces by
these Saracen curs before the Earl of Nevers and under
his very eyes. So you may understand, you who hear
this, what grief went to his heart, good and kind lord as
he is, and what pain it gave him to see thus martyred his
good and loyal companions, and his people that had been
so faithful to him, and who were so distinguished for
gallantry. Certes I think he was so grieved at heart,
that fain would he have been of their company in that
slaughter. And so the Turks led them one after another
to martyrdom, as men led in old times the blessed
martyrs, and struck their heads and chests and shoulders
fearfully with great knives, and felled them without
mercy. Well may one know with what woful countenances
they went in that sad procession. For even
as the butcher drags a lamb to the slaughter, so were our
good Christians, without a word being spoken, led to die
before the tyrant. But notwithstanding that their death
was hard and their case pitiful, every good Christian
should esteem them thrice fortunate, and born in a happy
hour, to receive such a death. For they must sometime
have died, and God gave them grace to die in the advancement
of the Christian religion, the holiest and worthiest
death (as we in our faith hold) that a Christian can die;
and also he made them to be the companions of the
blessed martyrs, the happiest of all the orders of Saints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in Paradise. For there is no doubt but that they are
Saints in Paradise, if they met their fate with good will.
In this piteous procession was Boucicaut, the Marshal of
France, naked, except his small clothes (petits draps).
But God, who willed not to lose his servant, for the
sake of the good service which he was to do thereafter,
as well in avenging the death of that glorious company
upon the Saracens, as in the other great benefits which
were to follow from his talents and by his means, caused
the Earl of Nevers to look at the Marshal and the Marshal
at him right sorrowfully, at the very moment that some one
was about to strike him. Then was the foresaid Earl
wonderfully vexed at heart for the death of such a man,
and he called to mind the great good, the prowess, loyalty,
and valour that were in him. So, on a sudden, God put it
in his mind to clasp his hands together as he looked at
Bajazet, and he made sign that the Marshal was to him
as a brother, and that he should respite him: which sign
Bajazet soon understood, and released him. When this
stern execution was complete, and the whole field was
strewed with the bodies of these blessed martyrs, as many
French as others of divers countries, that cursed Bajazet
arose, and ordered the Marshal, who had been so respited,
to be committed to prison in a large handsome town of
Turkey, called Bursa. So his bidding was done, and he
was kept there till the arrival of the said Bajazet.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Innumerable instances of the like ferocity might be
produced from Eastern history. Rowe’s polished and
pious Tamerlane put to death 100,000 persons in the
streets of Delhi. Few men have so well and fairly
estimated their own character, and the class to which
they belong, as did Nadir Shah, when to the remonstrance,
“If thou art a king, cherish and protect thy
people,&mdash;if a prophet, shew us the way of salvation,&mdash;if
a God, be merciful to thy creatures,” he replied, “I am
neither a king to protect my subjects, nor a prophet to
teach the way of salvation, nor a God to exercise the
attribute of mercy; but I am he whom the Almighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
has sent in his wrath to chastise a world of sinners.”
The following anecdote, striking in itself, is the more
interesting as an exception to a general rule: “In the
year 1068 Alp Arslan, the second sultan of Persia, of
the Seljukian dynasty, defeated and took prisoner Romanus
Diogenes, husband of Eudocia, the reigning empress
of Constantinople. He treated his prisoner with
extreme kindness and distinction; he uttered no reproaches
that could wound a humbled monarch, but gave
vent to the honest indignation of a warrior at the base
and cowardly conduct of those who had deserted and
abandoned so brave a leader. We are told that he asked
his captive at their first conference, what he would have
done if fortune had reversed their lot. ‘I would have
given thee many a stripe,’ was the imprudent and virulent
answer. This expression of haughty and unsubdued
spirit excited no anger in the brave and generous conqueror.
He only smiled, and asked Romanus what he
expected would be done to him? ‘If thou art cruel,’ said
the emperor, ‘put me to death. If vain&ndash;glorious, load
me with chains, and drag me to thy capital. If generous,
grant me my liberty!’ Alp Arslan was neither cruel
nor vain&ndash;glorious: he released his prisoner, gave all his
officers who were captives dresses of honour, and distinguished
them by every mark of friendship and regard.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Far from wishing to cast an undue reproach upon the
past by these melancholy details of cruelty and suffering,
we should have been glad to relieve the narrative by
more numerous instances of generosity and mercy. But
that these virtues are not the attributes of a savage race,
will readily be granted by all: that they are not necessarily
the fruit of refinement and civilization (if that term
be applicable to an advanced stage of art and knowledge,
without a corresponding improvement in moral wisdom)
is shown by the universal experience of the past, and nowhere
more forcibly than in the history of Greece and
Rome. The progress of society seems only to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
taught one lesson; that it is better to make the conquered
subservient to the profit or amusement of the conqueror,
than to put him to death, like any other formidable
or offensive animal. In man’s earliest and rudest
condition, as a hunter, slaves are worse than useless; for
sustenance is of more value than labour, and the precarious
supply of the chase is insufficient to provide
permanently and plentifully for his own wants. The
avenging or preventing encroachments upon each other’s
hunting&ndash;ground is therefore a most frequent cause of warfare
among neighbouring tribes, and the massacre of the
conquered is prompted equally by revenge and policy.
We find accordingly that in North America a prisoner’s
only chance of escape lay in being adopted into the hostile
tribe in the place of some one who had fallen in
battle. The still more savage practice of feasting upon
prisoners is sufficiently proved to have existed at a very
recent period in New Zealand. In other heathen countries
they have been reserved from indiscriminate slaughter,
only to perish on the altars of false gods. But labour
becomes valuable, and the command of labour an advantage,
in proportion as men emerge from barbarism, and
apply themselves to agriculture, or a pastoral life; and
when it is found out that a prisoner’s services may be
made worth more than his maintenance, the policy of the
victor changes, and he preserves an enemy whom formerly
he was almost compelled to destroy. Slavery,
therefore, is, in the infancy of nations, an index of increasing
civilization, and an amelioration of human misery,
since the bulk of mankind have ever hailed with joy
a respite from death, even though existence be attended
with degradation and suffering. A generous spirit, indeed,
would be little gratified at receiving life upon terms of
hopeless servitude; yet even to such the introduction of
slave labour lightened the evils of defeat. When men
were detained merely for the value of their services, it
was natural to release them if an equivalent for that value
were paid, and hence arose the custom of admitting prisoners
to ransom, which exercised a two&ndash;fold influence
in favour of slaves: first by enabling them to acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
freedom at the sacrifice of wealth; secondly, by removing
the utter hopelessness and degradation of their
state, and introducing a possibility that the slave and
master might some day be replaced in their original relation
to each other. This practice was familiar in the
Homeric age, though revenge or the heat of battle often
caused mercy and interest to be alike disregarded. Melancholy
indeed was the fate of a captured city. The
adult males were usually slaughtered, the females and
children reserved for slavery; those even of the highest
rank were employed as menial servants in the victor’s
household. “What evils,” says Priam, “does Jupiter
reserve me to behold on the threshold of age! My sons
slain, my daughters dragged into slavery, my chambers
plundered, the very infants dashed against the ground in
mournful warfare, and my sons’ wives dragged by the
destructive hands of the Greeks. The dogs which I fed
in my palace, at my own table, to protect it, will tear me,
even me, stretched dead at the outer door, as they lie
ravening in the vestibule lapping my blood. To a young
man it is becoming to lie slain in warfare, pierced by the
sharp sword; to such nothing that can happen in death
is unseemly. But that dogs should defile the grey head
and the grey beard of a slaughtered elder, this is the
mournfulest thing that happens to wretched mortals.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>For the lot of those who were reserved, we may quote
Hector’s parting speech to Andromache.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">I know the day draws nigh when Troy shall fall,<br />

<p class="p1">As time advanced the Greeks became more humane,
and the treatment of their prisoners improved; insomuch
that about the year 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> it seems to have been
usual among the Peloponnesian states to admit each
other’s citizens to ransom at a fixed sum of two minæ,
something less than eight pounds of our money;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and
the Athenians released certain B&oelig;otians for the same
sum.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The meridian splendour of Greece, as we shall
have future occasion to notice, is more especially dimmed
by the cold&ndash;blooded cruelty of her civil wars. It is observable,
however, that in the 10th year of the Peloponnesian
war, the mutual restoration of prisoners formed a
condition in a treaty of peace; and this, we believe, is the
first instance on record at all resembling the humane
usage of the present day.</p>

<p>In the youth of Rome, as she gradually extended her
dominion, cities were depopulated to be refilled by her
citizens, and their inhabitants sold like cattle, by public
auction.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In her days of greatness, when whole kingdoms
fell before her, the rights of conquest were necessarily
more leniently exercised; for nations cannot be
dispossessed and enslaved in mass. But the number of
Greek and of Syrian slaves in Rome shows that the
independence of those nations was not overturned without
a corresponding loss of private freedom; and those
uncivilised countries, which could contribute little else
of wealth to satiate a Roman general’s extortion, saw
droves of their inhabitants sold into captivity to supply
the labourers and gladiators of an idle and dissolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
empire.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The exemption of modern Europe, from
these horrors is chiefly referable to the influence of
Christianity, which, however ineffectual to purify the
minds and lives of a vast majority of those who have outwardly
embraced it, has given unquestionable proof of
its intrinsic excellence by refining and enlarging men’s
views of morality and benevolence, wherever its doctrines
have not been altogether obscured and corrupted.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
It is true that in the reign of Justinian, Constantinople
witnessed for the first and only time the insolent splendour
of a Roman triumph, granted to Belisarius after
the reduction of the Vandal kingdom; on which, as on
former occasions, the noblest of the conquered nation,
headed by Gelimer, their king, swelled the vainglorious
procession. But the changed spirit of the times is shown
in the subsequent treatment of them. To the king and
his family a safe retirement and an ample estate in
Galatia were allotted; and the flower of the Vandal
youth were enlisted, and served with distinction in the
Persian wars. Among other claims to our gratitude,
the clergy of the dark ages have the merit of steadily
resisting the practice of enslaving Christians. The
working of the feudal system was also beneficial in this
respect. The aristocracy of the land were also its soldiery;
to make prisoners, therefore, was a greater
object than to kill, for the ransom of prisoners was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
never&ndash;failing source of revenue to the brave and powerful.
And as the inferior classes might not be reduced
to domestic servitude, and besides passed naturally with
the land, whether as serfs, in absolute and acknowledged
bondage, or as vassals, free in name, but bound to
the soil by all the ties of property, the victor had no
interest in the detention of prisoners, except such as
were able to purchase freedom. The singular institutions
of chivalry also exercised a strong influence in humanizing
warfare. Knighthood formed a bond of union
throughout Europe. Men fought for gain, for honour,
for revenge; but victory, which ensured all but the last,
was seldom tarnished by cruelty, except in instances of
deadly feud. We are by no means inclined to overrate
the savage virtues of those times, or to deny that they
abound in examples of most flagrant cruelty and oppression;
but we contend, that compared with earlier ages,
place even barbarism against refinement, the half&ndash;savage
Teuton against the polished Greek or Roman, we see
the tokens of a vast improvement in this respect. And we
may further observe that of the cruelties recorded a large
proportion are foreign to the question, being perpetrated
in prosecution of the cherished spirit of revenge, or to
extract wealth from Jews, or others of inferior rank, and
not on prisoners of war. We do not plead this in extenuation
of those enormities; the evil passions of the
heart sprung up unchecked into a plentiful harvest of
evil actions: but of cruelty to their prisoners of war,
the Europeans and the middle ages were comparatively
guiltless. Among them, for the first time in history,
the victor and the defeated mixed in social intercourse
upon terms of equality, without degradation being felt
by the one, or an undue and ungenerous superiority assumed
by the other; each aware that on the morrow
the turn of fortune might reverse their situations, and
that disgrace attached to misfortune only when occasioned
by misconduct.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> And the lofty, though fantastic
notions of honour which prevailed, tended still further to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
lighten captivity, when the word of a knight was considered
as sufficient surety for his ransom, and prisoners
were enabled to obtain their release upon parole. Nowhere
is this courteous and humane spirit more strongly
marked than in the wars of England and Scotland during
the 14th century. Yet we might expect to find the
warfare of that century distinguished by more than
usual inhumanity. The perfidious aggression, the inveterate
hostility of Edward I., were calculated to raise
in the Scotch a most implacable resentment; while the
obstinate resistance and successful reprisals in which
our northern counties were repeatedly devastated, were
equally well fitted to inspire the English with no friendly
feelings towards their northern brethren. A hundred
years had elapsed since the first quarrel, during which
the sword had scarcely been sheathed, the fire of burning
villages scarcely quenched. We might reasonably
then expect to find these wars carried on “à outrance;”
to find no mercy in their battles, no gentleness
or generosity in their intercourse. But the account of
Froissart is very different.</p>

<p>“Englysshmen on the one partye, and scottes on the
other partye, are goode men of warre, for when they
mete there is a hard fight, without sparynge; there is
no troo bytwene them as long as speares, swordes, axes,
or dagers wyll endure, but lay on eche upon other; and
whan they be well beaten, and that the one parte hath
optaygned the victory, they then glorifye so in their
dedes of armes, and are so ioyfull, that such as be taken,
they shall be raunsomed or they go out of the felde, so
that shortely eche of them is so content with other, that
at their departynge curtoysly they will saye, Gode
thank you, but in fyghtynge one with another there is no
playe, nor sparynge; and this is trewe, and that shall
well apere by this sayde rencounter (of Otterbourn), for it
was as valyauntly foughten as coulde be devysed....
This batayle was fierse and cruell, tyll it came to the
end of the discomfiture; but whan the scottes saw the
englysshmen recule, and yelde themselves, than the
scottes were curtes, and sette them to their raunsom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and every manne sayde to his prisoner, Sirs, go and
unarm you and take your ease, I am your mayster;
and so made their prisoners as goode chere as though
they had been brethern, without doyng them any
damage.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Another anecdote of the same battle, from the same
graphic and delightful historian, will serve to illustrate
more than one of the points to which the reader’s attention
has been drawn. Sir Matthew Reedman, the
governor of Berwick, fought under Percy at Otterbourn
and endeavoured to escape when fortune declared against
the English.</p>

<p>“Now I shall shewe you of sir Mathue Reedman,
who was on horsback to save himselfe, for he alone
coulde not remedy the mater: at his departing sir James
Lynsay was nere to hym, and sawe how sir Mathue
departed, and this sir James, to wyn honour, folowed
in chase sir Mathue Reedman, and came so nere hym,
that he myght have stryken hym with his speare if he
had lyst; than he sayd, Ah sir knyght, tourne, it is a
shame thus to flye: I am James of Lynsay: if ye will
not tourne I shall stryke ye on the back with my spere.
Sir Mathue spake no worde, but strake his horse with
the spurs sorer than he dyde before. In this maner he
chased hym more than thre myles, and at last sir Mathue
Reedman’s horse foundred and fell under hym: than he
stepte forthe on the erthe, and drewe oute his sworde,
and took corage to defende hymselfe: and the scotte
thought to have stryken him on the brest, but sir Mathue
Reedman swarved from the stroke, and the speare poynt
entred into the erthe: then sir Mathue strake asonder
the spere with his sworde; and whan sir James Lynsay
sawe howe he had loste his speare, he caste awaye the
tronchon, and lyghted afote, and toke a lytell batayle&ndash;axe
that he caryed at his backe, and handeled it with
his one hande, quickely and delyverly, in the whiche
feate scottes be well experte, and than he set at sir
Mathue and he defended hymselfe properly. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
they tourneyed toguyder, one with an axe, and the
other with a swerde, a long season, and no man to lette
them: fynally, sir James Lynsay gave the knyght
suche strokes, and helde hym so shorte, that he was
putte out of brethe in such wyse that he yelded hymselfe
and sayde, Sir James Lynsay, I yelde me to you. Well,
quod he, and I receyve you, rescue or no rescue. I am
content, quod Reedman, so you deale with me lyke a
good companyon. I shall nat fayle that, quod Lynsay,
and so putte up his swerde. Well, sir, quod Reedman,
what wyll you nowe that I shall do? I am your prisoner,
ye have conquered me; I wolde gladly go agayne to
Newcastell, and within fyftene dayes I shall come to
you into Scotlande, whereas ye shall assigne me. I am
content, quod Lynsay: ye shall promyse by your faythe
to present yourself within this thre wekes at Edenborowe,
and wheresoever ye go, to reporte yourselfe my prisoner.
All this sir Mathue sware, and promysed to fulfyll. Than
eche of them toke their horses, and toke leave, eche of
other. Sir James returned, and his entent was to go to
his owne company the same way as he came, and sir
Mathue Reedman to Newcastell. Sir James Lynsay
could nat keep the ryght waye as he came: it was
darke, and a myst, and he hadde nat rydden halfe a
myle, but he met face to face with the bysshoppe of
Durham and mo than v hundred Englysshmen with hym:
he myght wel have escaped, if he had wolde, but he
supposed it had been his owne company that had pursued
the Englisshmen: whan he was among them, one demaunded
of hym what he was. I am, quod he, sir James
Lynsay. The bysshoppe herde those words, and stepte
to hym, and sayde, Lynsay, ye are taken; yelde ye to
me. Who be you? quod Lynsay. I am, quod he, the
bysshop of Durham. And fro whens come ye, sir? quod
Lynsay. I come fro the batayle, quod the bysshoppe,
but I strake never a stroke there; I go back to Newcastell
for this night, and ye shall go with me. I may
nat chuse, quod Lynsay, sithe you will have it so: I
have taken, and I am taken; such is the adventures of
armes. Whom have ye taken? quod the bysshop. Sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
quod he, I toke in the chase sir Mathue Reedman. And
where is he? quod the bysshop. By my faythe, sir, he
is retourned to Newcastell: he desyred me to trust hym
on his fayth for thre wekes, and so have I done. Well,
quod the bysshop, lette us go to Newcastell, and there
ye shall spake with hym. Thus they rode to Newcastell
toguyder, and sir James Lynsay was prisoner to
the bisshop of Durham.”</p>

<p>“After that sir Mathue Reedman was retourned to
Newcastell, and hadde shewed to dyvers howe he had
been taken prisoner by sir James Lynsay; than it was
shewed him howe the bisshoppe of Durham had taken
the sayd sir James Lynsay, and how that he was thene
in the towne as his prisoner: as sone as the bysshoppe
was departed, sir Mathue Reedman wente to the
bysshoppes lodgyng to see his mayster, and there he
founde hym in a studye, lyeng in a wyndowe, and sayd,
What, sir James Lynsay, what make you here? Than
sir James came forth of the studye to hym, and gave
hym good morowe, and sayd, By my fayth, sir Mathue,
fortune hath brought me hyder; for as sone as I was
departed fro you, I mette by chaunce the bysshoppe of
Durham, to whome I am prisoner, as ye be to me. I
beleve ye shall nat nede to come to Edenborowe to me
to make your fynaunce: I think rather we shall make
an exchaunge one for another, if the bysshoppe be so
contente. Well, sir, quod Reedman, we shall accorde
ryght well toguyder: ye shall dyne this daye with me;
the bysshop and our men be gone forthe to fyght with
your men. I can not tell what shall fall; we shall know
at their retourne. I am content to dyne with you, quod
Lynsay. Thus these two knyghtes dyned toguyder in,
Newcastell.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Some danger unquestionably there was, that where
the marketable value of prisoners was so clearly recognised,
humanity would be forgotten in avarice; a lapse
of memory which our acquaintance with Algiers and
other piratical states proves not altogether impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
One of the causes which prevented this, the union and
equality produced by knighthood, has been alluded to;
and we may find another in the high&ndash;spirited notions of
personal honour which prevailed.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> To refuse a prisoner
his liberty upon payment of ransom, either
directly or covertly, by demanding a sum disproportionate
to his rank and means, was held dishonourable; for a
knight would have esteemed himself disgraced if it
could be suspected that he retained an enemy in prison
through fear of meeting him in the open field. “After
that the Prince of Wales was returned from Spain into
Acquitayne, and his brother, the Duke of Lancastre,
into Englande, and every lorde into his owne, sir Bertram
du Guesclin was styll prisoner with the prince, and
with sir Johan Chandos, and coulde nat come to his
raunsome, nor fynaunce, the whiche was sore displeasaunt
to kyng Henry,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> if he might have mended it: and it so
fortuned after, as I was enformed, that on a day the
prince called to hym sir Bertram du Guesclin, and demaunded
of hym how he dyde; he answered and sayd,
Sir, it was never better with me; it is reason that it
shulde be so, for I am in prison with the most renowned
knyght of the worlde. With whome is that? sayd the
prince. Sir, quoth he, that is with Sir Johan Chandos;
and, sir, it is sayd in the realme of Fraunce, and in other
places, that ye feare me so moche, that ye dare nat let me
out of prison, the whiche to me is full great honour. The
prince, who understode well the wordes of sir Bertram
du Guesclin, and parceyved well how his own counsayle
wolde in no wyse that he shuld delyver hym, unto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
tyme that king Don Peter had payed him all suche
sommes as he was bound to do. Than he sayd to sir
Bertram, Sir, then ye thinke that we kepe you for feare
of your chivalry; nay, thynke it nat, for I swere by
saint George, it is nat so; therfore pay for your raunsome
an hundred thousand fraunkes, and ye shall be
delyvered. Sir Bertram, who desyred gretly to be delyvered,
and herde on what poynt he might depart, toke
the prince with that worde, and sayd, Sir, in the name
of God so be it, I wyll pay no lasse. And whan the prince
herde hym say so, he wolde than gladly have repented
hymselfe; and also some of his counsayle came to hym,
and sayd, Sir, ye have nat done well so lightly to put him
to his raunsome. And so they wolde gladly have caused
the prince to have revoked that covenant; but the
prince, who was a true and noble knight, sayd, Sithe
that we agreed therto, we wyll nat breke our promise;
it shulde be to us a grete rebuke, shame and reproche,
if we shulde nat put him to raunsome, seyng he is content
to pay such a grete somme as an hundred thousand
fraunkes.”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The following story of William Rufus, which is told
by William of Malmsbury, illustrates the character of
the man, rather than the spirit of the age. Helias de
Flechia laid claim to the city of Mans, part of that monarch’s
continental possessions. He was taken and
brought before William, who said insultingly, “I have
you, sir.” “You have taken me by chance,” said the
baron; “could I escape, I should find something new to
do.” The hot&ndash;headed king, shaking his fist, replied,
“You rascal, what would you do? Troop, shog off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
make yourself scarce&mdash;you may do what you can; and
by the face of St. Luke, if you get the better of me, I
will ask you nothing for this favour.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>In conclusion we give a celebrated passage from
English history, which is strongly and pleasantly contrasted
with the early part of the chapter. It is well
known that the king of France was taken prisoner by
the Black Prince at the battle of Poictiers. “The day
of the batayle at night, the prince made a supper in his
lodginge to the frenche kyng, and to the moost parte
of the great lordes that were prisoners: the prince made
the kynge, and his son, the lorde James of Bourbon,
the lorde John D’Artois, the erle of Tancarville, the
erle D’Estampes, the erle Dampmertyne, the erle of
Gravyll, and the lorde of Pertenay, to syt all at one
borde, and other lordes, knyghtes, and squiers at other
tables; and alwayes the prince served before the kyng
as humbly as he coude, and wolde nat syt at the kynges
borde, for any desyre that the kynge could make: but
sayd he was nat sufficient to syt at the table with so
great a prince as the kyng was; but than he sayd to the
kyng, Sir, for goddes sake make none yvell, nor heavy
chere, though god this day dyd not consent to folowe
your wyll: for syr, surely the kyng my father shall bere
you as moche honour and amyte as he may do, and shall
acorde with you so reasonably that ye shall ever be
frendes toguyder after; and sir, methinke ye ought to
reioyse, though the journey<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> be nat as ye wolde have
had it, for this day ye have wonne the hygh renome of
prowes, and have past this day in valyantnesse all other
of your partie: sir, I say natte this to mocke you, for alle
that be on our partie that saw every mannes dedes are
playnly acorded by true sentence to gyve you the price
and chapelette. Therewith the frenchemen began to
murmure, and sayd among themselves how the prince
had spoken nobly; and that by all estimation he shulde
prove a noble man, if Gode send him lyfe, to perceyver
in such good fortune. Whan supper was done, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
man went to his lodgyng with their prisoners: the same
night they put many to raunsome, and beleyved them
upon their faythes and trouthes, and raunsomed them
but easily, for they sayde, <i>they wolde sette no knyghts
raunsom so hygh, but that he might pay at his ease and
mayntaygne still his degree</i>.</p>

<p>“The same wynter the prince of Wales, and such of
Englande as were with him at Bardeaux, ordayned for
shippes, to convey the frenche king and his son and all
other prisoners into Englande. Then he took the see,
and certayne lordes of Gascoyne with hym: the frenche
kyng was in a vessell by hymselfe, to be the more at hys
ease, accompanyed with two hundred men at arms, and
two thousand archers: for it was showed the prince that
the thre estates, by whom the realme of France was
governed, had layed in Normandy and Crotoy two great
armyes to the entent to mete with hym, and to gette
the frenche kyng out of his handes if they might: but
there were no such that apered, and yet thei were on the
see xi dayes, and on the xii day they aryved at Sandwych;
then they yssued out of their shyppe, and lay
there all that nyghte, and taryed there two dayes to
refresh them; and on the therde day they rode to
Canterbury. When the kynge of Englande knew of
their commynge, he commaunded them of London to
prepare theym, and their cyte, to receyve suche a man
as the frenche kyng was: then they of London arrayed
themselfe, by companyes, and the chief maisters clothing
different fro the other; at saynt Thomas of Canterbury
the frenche kyng and the prince made their offerynges,
and there taryed a day, and than rode to Rochester, and
taryed there that day, and the next day to Dartforde,
and the fourth day to London, wher they were honourably
receyved, and so they were in every good towne as
they passed: the frenche kynge rode through London on
a whyte courser, well aparelled, and the prince on a
lyttell black hobbey by hym: thus he was conveyed along
the cyte till he came to the Savoy, the which house pertayned
to the heritage of the duke of Lancaster; there
the frenche kynge kept hys house a long season, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
thyder came to se hym the kyng and the quene ofttimes,
and made him great feest and chere.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>It has been said that the Prince’s conduct was too
ostentatiously humble; that in refusing to sit at table
with the King of France, and in making him the principal
object of attention in their entry into London, he
exceeded the modesty of a conqueror, and exposed himself
to the charge of hypocrisy. The censure is, we
think, erroneous, and arises from ignorance of the feelings
of the times. The humility of the Black Prince
was that of a vassal in presence of his feudal lord, due,
not because he owed allegiance to the King of France,
but because that monarch was the peer of the King of
England, and in courtesy entitled, especially as a visitor,
though a forced one, to an equal measure of respect
from his subjects. The victor merely overlooked the
fortune of war, and paid to his royal prisoner the homage
which he would have shown to his father, and which
the King of France would have received from the heir
to his own crown.</p>

<h2 class="p4">EXTRACT FROM THE LIFE OF MESSIRE BERTRAND DU GUESCLIN.</h2>

<p class="pc1 lmid">(<i>Referred to in the Note, p. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>.</i>)</p>

<p class="pn2">“One day the Prince of Wales was risen from dinner,
and gone into a private chamber with his barons, who
had been served with wine and spices. So they began
to speak of many a bold deed of arms, of love&ndash;passages,
of battles, and of prisons, and how St. Louis to save his
life was made prisoner in Tunis, from whence he was
ransomed for fine gold, paid down by weight. Until
the Prince, who spoke without caution, said, ‘When a
good knight well approved in battle is made prisoner in
fair feat of arms, and has rendered himself, and sworn to
abide prisoner, he should on no account depart without
his master’s leave. And also one should not demand
such portion of his substance, that he be unable to equip
himself again.’ When the Sire de Lebret heard these
words, he began to take heed, and said to him, ‘Noble
Sire, be not angry with me if I relate what I have heard
said of you in your absence.’ ‘By my faith,’ said the
Prince, ‘right little should I love follower of mine sitting
at my table, if he heard said a word against my honour,
and apprised me not of it.’ ‘Sire,’ said he of Lebret, ‘men
say that you hold in prison a knight whose name I well
know, whom you dare not delyver.’ ‘It is true,’ said
Oliver de Clisson, ‘I have heard speak of it.’ Then the
Prince swore and boasted, ‘that he knew no knight in the
world, but, if he were his prisoner, he would put him to a
fair ransom, according to his ability.’ And Lebret said,
‘How then do you forget Bertrand du Guesclin, that he
cannot get away?’ And when the Prince heard this, his
colour changed; and he was so tempted by pride, anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and disdain, that he commanded Bertrand to be brought
before him; with whom he wished to make terms, in spite
of all who had spoken of the matter, and would fain not
let him be ransomed, unless they themselves should fix
the amount. Then certain knights went and found Bertrand,
who, to amuse himself and forget his weariness,
was talking with his chamberlain. Which knights
saluted him. And Bertrand arose towards them, and
showed a fair seeming, saying ‘that they were come in
good time.’ Then he ordered the aforesaid chamberlain
to bring wine. The knights answered ‘that it was right
fitting they should have much wine, good and strong;
for they brought him good, joyful, and pleasant news
with good will.’ Then one of them who was wise and
discreet said, ‘that the Prince sent for him to appear in
his presence, and he thought that he would be ransomed
by help of those friends he had at court, who
were many.’ ‘What say you?’ said Bertrand; ‘I have
neither halfpenny nor penny, and owe more than ten
thousand livres, that have been lent me, which debt has
accrued in this city while I have been prisoner.’ One
of them inquired of him, ‘How have you accounted for
so much?’ ‘I will answer for that,’ said Bertrand; ‘I
have eaten, drunk, given, and played at dice with it.
A little money is soon spent. But if I be set free,
I shall soon have paid it: he saves his money, and
has it in good keeping, who shall for my help lend
me the keys of it.’ And an officer who heard him said,
‘Sir, you are stout&ndash;hearted, it seems to you that
every thing which you would have must happen.’ ‘By
my faith,’ said Bertrand, ‘you are right, for a dispirited
man is nothing better than beaten and discomfited.’ And
the rest said, ‘that he was like one enchanted, for he
was proof against every shock.’ Then he was brought
to the chamber where was the Prince of Wales, and with
him John Chandos, a true and valiant knight. And
had they chosen to believe him, they would long before
have disposed of the war: for he gave much good advice.
And also there were Oliver de Clisson and other knights,
before whom came Bertrand, wearing a grey coat. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
when the Prince saw him, he could not keep from laughing,
from the time he saw him. Then he said, ‘Well,
Bertrand, how fare you?’ And Bertrand approached
him, bowing a little, and said, ‘Sir, when it shall please
you, I may fare better: many a day have I heard the
rats and mice, but the song of birds it is long since I
heard.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> I shall hear them when it is your pleasure.’
‘Bertrand,’ said the Prince, ‘that shall be when you will;
it will depend only on yourself, so that you will swear,
and make true oath, never to bear arms against me, nor
these others, nor to assist Henry of Spain. So soon as
you will swear this, we will fully set you free, and pay
that you owe, and besides give 10,000 florins to equip
you anew, if you consent to this; else you shall not go.’
‘Sire,’ said Bertrand, ‘my deliverance then will not
come to pass; for before I do so, may I lie by the leg
in prison while I live. God willing, I will never be a
reproach to my friends. For by Him who made the
world, I will serve with my whole heart those whom I
have served, and whose I have been from my outset.
These are the good King of France, the noble Dukes
of Anjou, of Berry, of Burgundy, and of Bourbon;
whose I have been, as became me. But so please you,
suffer me to go. For you have held me too long in
prison, wrongfully and without cause; and I will tell
you how I had gone from France, I and my people
meaning to go against the Saracens. And so I had
promised Hugh de Carvalay, intending to work out my
salvation.’ ‘Why then went you not straight without
stopping?’ said the Prince. ‘I will tell you,’ said Bertrand
in a loud voice. ‘We found Peter,&mdash;the curse of
God confound him! who had long since thrice falsely
murdered his noble Queen, born of the noble line of Bourbon,
and of the blood of my Lord, St. Louis, which lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
was your cousin by the best blood in your body. Straightway
then I stopped, to take vengeance for her, and to
help Henry; for well I know, and surely I believe, that he
is the right king and the true heir of Spain. And also to
destroy, and put to an end, Jews and Saracens, of whom
there are too many in these parts. Now through great
pride you have come to Spain to the best of your ability,
both through covetousness of gold and silver, and that you
may have the throne after the death of Peter, who reigns
wrongfully, by which journey you have, in the first place,
injured your own blood, and troubled me and my people:
whence it has come to pass, that after you have so ruined
your friends, and you and your people have been all
famished, and suffered great pain and labour, Peter has
deceived you by cheating and trickery, for he has not
kept faith nor covenant with you, for which, by my
faith, I thank him heartily.’ When Bertrand had related
his reasons, the Prince rose, and could not help
saying that on his soul Bertrand was right, and the
barons said that he had spoken truth. Then was there
great joy stirring all round and about, and they said of
Bertrand, one to another, ‘See there a brave Breton.’
But the Prince called, and said to him, ‘You shall not
escape me without paying a good ransom; and yet it
vexes me that you obtain such favour. But men say
that I keep you prisoner because I fear you; and to the
end that every one may cease to suspect this, and may
know that I neither fear nor care for you, I will deliver
you on payment of sufficient ransom.’ ‘Sir,’ said Bertrand,
‘I am a poor knight of little name, and not so born
as that I should find help in plenty. And besides, my
estate is mortgaged for purchase of war&ndash;horses, and also I
owe in this town full ten thousand florins. Be moderate,
therefore, and deliver, me.’ ‘Where will you go, fair
Sir?’ said the Prince. ‘Sir,’ said Bertrand, ‘I will go
where I may regain my loss, and more I say not.’ ‘Consider
then,’ said the Prince, ‘what ransom you will give
me: for what you will shall be enough for me.’ ‘Sir,’
said Bertrand, ‘I trust you will not stoop to retract your
meaning. And since you are content to refer it to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
pleasure, I ought not to value myself too low. So I will
give and engage for my freedom one hundred thousand
double golden florins.’ And when the Prince heard him
his colour changed, and he looked round at his knights,
saying, ‘Does he mean to make game of me that he
offers such a sum? for I would gladly quit him for the
quarter.’ ‘Bertrand,’ said he, ‘neither can you pay it,
nor do I wish such a sum; so consider again.’ ‘Sire,’
said Bertrand, ‘since you will not so much, I place myself
at sixty thousand double florins; you shall not have
less, sobeit you will discharge me.’ ‘Well,’ said the
Prince, ‘I agree to it.’ Then said Bertrand loudly,
‘Sir, Prince Henry may well and truly vaunt that he
will die King of Spain, cost him what it may, and he
will lend me one half my ransom, and the King of France
the other; and if I can neither go nor send to these two,
I would get all the spinstresses in France to spin it rather
than that I should remain longer in your hands.’<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> And
when the Prince had heard him he thus said: ‘What
sort of man is this? He startles at nothing, either in act
or thought, no more than if he had all the gold which
is in the world. He has set himself at sixty thousand
double florins, and I would willingly have quitted him
for ten thousand.’ And all the barons also marvelled
greatly. ‘Am I then at liberty?’ said the gallant Bertrand.
And Chandos asked him whence the money
should come. ‘Sir,’ said he, ‘I have good friends, as I
shall find, I am certain.’ ‘By my faith,’ said Chandos,
‘I am much rejoiced therefore, and if you have need of
my help, thus much I say, I will lend you ten thousand.’
‘Sir,’ said Bertrand, ‘I thank you. But before I seek
anything of you I will try the people of my own country.’
The news of this matter went through the city of Bordeaux.
There you might see all persons, great and
small, citizens, and artisans of all sorts, run towards the
mansion of the Prince to see Bertrand. And when the
Prince’s knights saw the people assemble thus, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
knew the cause of their coming, they brought the said
Bertrand to lean out at a window, who laughed heartily
at the matter. And when the commoners saw him from
a distance, they said, ‘He is a downright enemy! cursed
be the hour that he escapes alive. He has done much
evil, and will do worse.’ And others said, ‘Have we
idled and yawned, and run away from our business, to
look at such a squire as this? May God bless him not!
for he is an ugly fellow, and unable to pay the ransom
at which he is valued.’ ‘Whence should he draw it?’
said others; ‘he will never pay a single penny of his
own, but will pilfer it through the broad land.’ And
those who knew Bertrand better said to them, ‘Now
argue not so much in using such words, for there is no
better knight in the world, and none that better knows
how to make war. And there is no castle, however
strong, however high the rock on which it stands, that
would not soon surrender if he went thither to assault
it: and, throughout the kingdom of France, there is no
man nor woman, however poor, who would not contribute,
if he needed it, rather than that he should remain in
prison.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">Tyranny of Cambyses, terminating in madness&mdash;of Caligula&mdash;of
the Emperor Paul.</p>

<p class="pn">No questions which can become the subject of judicial
examination are more delicate and difficult than those
which depend upon a man’s mental sanity, whether the
case be of a civil or a criminal nature; whether it regard
his competence to manage his own affairs, or his
possession of that moral feeling of right and wrong in
the absence of which he cannot be justly punished as a
responsible agent. In the first instance, daily experience
shows us that general eccentricity, and even delusion
upon particular subjects, may exist in union with the
most acute perception of personal interests; in the
second, it is equally clear that the moral sense may be
perverted upon one or more points without being destroyed,
and indeed without any other indication of mental
disease. We may take as an example of this the burning
of York Cathedral some years ago. Martin believed
this to be morally a meritorious act, and herein lay his
madness: on a case of murder, robbery, or any other infraction
of the laws, he would have judged aright. But
though he believed it to be meritorious, he knew it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
be illegal; he knew that he was subject to punishment,
and fled from it accordingly: and upon this ground the
question might be raised, whether his madness should
have protected him from the penalty affixed to his act.
But exclusively of those more strongly marked cases,
which alone are likely to become subjects of judicial inquiry,
no man can converse extensively with the living,
or, through the medium of books, with the dead, without
continually asking himself whether the eccentricity, perverseness,
intemperance, and extravagance which he sees
on all sides are compatible with a perfectly sound state of
mind. Mental as well as bodily illness may assume all
shapes, and be of all degrees: and both reflection and
observation lead us to conclude that excessive indulgence
of the passions will impair the understanding, as surely
as sensual intemperance injures the constitution. It
would not be difficult to enumerate a long list of causes
tending more or less to unsettle the reason; indeed, no
pursuit, however unexciting it may seem, can be exclusively
followed without risk of this result. Science
has its dangers as well as love: the philosopher’s stone
and the quadrature of the circle have probably turned
as many heads as has female ingratitude, from the time
of Orlando Furioso downwards. At present, however,
we mean to confine ourselves to one particular manifestation
of insanity, or something nearly allied to it, with
the view of illustrating, in some degree, that large portion
of history which is occupied by the crimes and
follies of absolute monarchs.</p>

<p>In reading such narratives as the following, we naturally
wonder how it is that anything human can have
been led to play a part so entirely at variance with all
the kindly feelings of human nature. To believe that
Caligula and Nero came into the world fully prepared for
the part which they were afterwards to play, would be
as unreasonable as to adopt the other extreme, and maintain,
as some have done, that the tempers and abilities of
all men are originally similar and equal. But “the
child is father of the man.” The work of education
begins at an early period, and circumstances seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
too trivial to notice, may exert a powerful effect in
fixing our future destiny for good or evil. There are
few persons whose patience has not been more or less
tried by spoiled children, and who cannot point out examples
where the temper of the mature man has been
seriously injured by early injudicious indulgence; and
many must know cases in which the paroxysms of a
naturally bad temper, exasperated by uncontrolled licence
and habitual submission, have amounted almost to occasional
insanity. Causes closely analogous to those which
render one man the dread of his domestic circle, may
render another the terror and the scourge of half the
earth. The same spirit which vents itself in ill&ndash;humour
for a broken piece of china, or execrations for an ill&ndash;cooked
dinner, if fostered by power, might correct
breaches of etiquette with the knout, and deal out confiscations
and death as unsparingly as oaths. We may
observe that, bloody and unfeeling as their administration
may have been, it is not among the adventurers who have
carved their own way to a crown that the wantonness
of tyranny has been most developed; it is rather among
their descendants, men nurtured among parasites, with
the prospect of despotism ever before their eyes. Surrounded
from infancy by those whose interest it has been
to pamper, not to repress their evil passions, taught, in
Pagan countries, to regard themselves as gods, and worshipped
as such by a servile and besotted multitude,
what wonder that they tread under foot those who bow
the neck before them, and scorn to sympathise with a
confessedly inferior race? In private life, however, the
regulation of the mind may be neglected, the supremacy
of law, and the knowledge that excess, beyond a certain
point, cannot be committed with impunity, exerts a
salutary restraint over the wildest spirits. But he who
is above the influence of fear, whose angry passions have
never been checked, nor his desires controlled, and who
is harassed by the craving after excitement consequent
upon satiety of sensual pleasures, is prepared for any
caprice or enormity which the humour of the moment
may suggest. The mind can hardly be thus morally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
depraved without becoming intellectually depraved also:
as the animal man is cherished, and the reasonable man
neglected, the former will assume the guidance due to
the latter, and human becomes little superior to brute
nature, except in its greater power to do mischief. In
this state of degradation</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">Even&ndash;handed justice<br />
Condemns the ingredients of the poisoned chalice<br />
To our own lips.</p>

<p class="pn1">The dominion of the passions is worse than external
oppression, and conscience exasperates, after it has lost
its power to reform. Misery may then complete the
ruin which intemperance began, and cruelty, from being
only indifferent, become congenial.</p>

<p>If a man deprives himself almost of the common
necessaries of life, for the purpose of accumulating
money which he will never use or want; if he sleeps
all day, and wakes all night; if he chooses to wear his
shoes upon his hands, and his gloves upon his feet, or
indulge in any other such ridiculous fancies; we call
him odd, eccentric, a madman, according to the degree
of his deviation from established usages: and justly, for
in all these things a sound mind is wanting. Yet that
man may be perfectly able to foresee the consequences
of his actions, perfect master of his reason upon every
subject; and therefore be both legally and morally responsible.
It is a state of mind strictly analogous, as we
believe, to this, which has produced the worst excesses
of the worst oppressors; and one which has sprung
from the same cause&mdash;habitual submission to the will
instead of the reason. From the childish passion of
George II., who manifested his displeasure on great occasions
by kicking his hat about the room, to the superhuman
crimes of Caligula, we find this disease, if we may
call it so, manifested in every variety of degree and
form. In Henry VIII. of England, we trace it in the
contrast between the early and later years of his reign,
in the increased violence of his passions, and in the
capriciousness and cruelty ingrafted on a temper not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
naturally ungentle. We ascribe to it the ungovernable
fury which obscured the brilliant qualities of Peter of
Russia; and we find it still more strongly marked in the
extravagances which are ascribed to Xerxes. His very
preparations for invading Greece, on a scale so disproportionate
to the value of his object if attained, show
how subordinate was his judgment to his inclinations;
and no one can read the narration of his chastisement of
the Hellespont, without recognising the weakness of a
mind unsettled by extravagant presumption. “When
Xerxes heard that his bridges were carried away, he was
much vexed, and ordered three hundred lashes to be
given to the Hellespont, and a pair of fetters to be cast
into it. And I have heard that he sent men at the
same time to brand the Hellespont. Moreover, he commanded
those that inflicted the stripes to use unholy and
barbarian language, saying, ‘Thou bitter water, thy
master inflicts this punishment upon thee, because thou
hast wronged him, having received no injury at his
hands. And King Xerxes will cross thee, whether thou
wilt or no: and, as is fit, no one sacrifices to thee,
because thou art a salt and crafty river.’ So he ordered
them to punish the sea thus, and to cut off the heads of
the Grecians who had charge of the bridge.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> This is
as downright frenzy as the walls of Bedlam ever witnessed:
a paroxysm of temporary insanity, produced by
disappointment acting on a vain, ungoverned mind.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to relate in detail the lives of some
remarkable persons which bear upon the point in question,
we wish briefly to allude to the very singular
and striking history of Nebuchadnezzar, though with
no view of resolving that preternatural visitation, which
is expressly stated to have been from God, into a natural
consequence of his intemperate pride. From the few
notices of him preserved in the Bible, he seems to have
been a man cast in no ordinary mould; to have been endowed
with powers and capability of excellence commensurate
with the exalted situation which he was appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to hold. It is evident, however, that he had
drunk deep of the intoxication of despotism. His intended
massacre of the wise men, and the Chaldeans, in
point of wisdom and justice is on a par with the anger of
a child who beats his nurse because she will not give
him the moon to play with; and his conduct with respect
to the image of the plain of Dura, if less preposterous,
is not more creditable to his notions of toleration
or humanity. In fact, he appears to have been in a fair
way to become as truculent a tyrant as Cambyses
or Caligula, when that awful vision, related at length in
the fourth chapter of Daniel, was presented to him,
which foretold his banishment from the throne and from
men: and we may infer from the warning of the inspired
interpreter, and from the course of the narrative, that
his overweening pride and hardness of heart, the food
and origin of that mental alienation of which we have
been speaking at such length, were the vices against
which Divine anger was especially directed. “This is
the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my
lord the king: They shall drive thee from men, and thy
dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, till thou
know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of
men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will....
Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto
thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine
iniquities by showing mercy to the poor: if it may be a
lengthening of thy tranquillity.... At the end of
twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom
of Babylon. The king spoke and said, Is not this the
great Babylon that I have built for the house of the
kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honour
of my majesty? While the word was in the king’s
mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O King
Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; the kingdom is
departed from thee. And they shall drive thee from
men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the
field; they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and
seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth
it to whomsoever he will.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Of the following sketches the two first exhibit the
dominion of passion in its most violent form; the last
differs rather in degree than in nature. Strictly speaking,
the life of Cambyses is not entitled to a place here; but
Herodotus makes us so familiar with Persian history from
the time of Cyrus, that it seems naturally to find a place
in works relating to the history of Greece.</p>

<p>Cambyses succeeded to the undisturbed possession of
that vast empire which his father Cyrus had acquired,
extending from the Indus to the Ægean, and from the
Caspian to the Red Sea. This extent of dominion might
seem enough to satisfy the most ambitious, and employ
the most active mind; but the son, unhappily for himself,
inherited the father’s military spirit, and in the fourth
year of his reign quitted his paternal kingdom to conquer
Egypt. He marched along the coast from Palestine to
Pelusium, where he found encamped Psammenitus, who
had succeeded his father Amasis on the Egyptian throne.
A battle was fought, in which the Egyptians were defeated;
they fled to Memphis, and the rest of the country
submitted without further struggle. Herodotus, who
visited the field of battle, relates a curious story. The
bones of either nation were heaped apart, as they had
been originally separated; and the Persian skulls were
so weak that you could throw a pebble through them,
whereas the Egyptian would hardly break, though beaten
with a large stone. Their descendants do not appear to
have degenerated in this respect.</p>

<p>Cambyses sent a ship of Mitylene up the Nile, to
summon Memphis to surrender. The savage and exasperated
inhabitants tore the herald and crew limb from
limb, and made a long defence, during which the Cyrenæans
and the neighbouring Libyans submitted. The
city being at last taken, he put Psammenitus to a singular
trial.</p>

<p>“On the tenth day after the capture of Memphis, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
placed Psammenitus, together with other Egyptians,
without the gates; and meaning to make essay of his
temper, he acted thus. He clothed that king’s daughter
in servile raiment, and sent her, bearing a water&ndash;pitcher,
to fetch water, and with her other maidens of the noblest
families similarly clad. And as they went with wailing
and lamentation past their fathers, these, all but Psammenitus,
re&ndash;echoed their cries, seeing the evil condition
of their children; but he bowed his head to the earth.
When they had passed, his son came by with two thousand
Egyptians of like age, with bits in their mouths,
and their necks bound with halters, who were thus led
to death in retaliation for the Mityleneans who were
slain at Memphis. For the royal judges had decided
that for every one of them ten of the noblest Egyptians
should perish. And he, seeing them pass, and knowing
that his son was carried to execution, while his countrymen
who were around him wept and were much distressed,
did as in the case of his daughter. When they
were gone, an old man, who was formerly of his drinking
parties, being now deprived of his fortune, and compelled
to beg through the army, chanced to come where Psammenitus
was sitting; and Psammenitus, when he saw his
friend, cried aloud, and smote his head, calling upon
him by name. Men were placed near, who told Cambyses
every thing that happened; and he was much
surprised, and sent this message: ‘Psammenitus, your
master Cambyses asks why, having given way neither
to cries nor tears when you saw your daughter maltreated
and your son going to execution, you have
honoured with them a man nowise related to you?’
He answered, ‘Son of Cyrus, my domestic misfortunes
were too mighty to be wept; but the sufferings of a
friend, who, on the threshold of old age, has fallen from
a high and happy state into beggary, form a fit subject
for tears.’”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The heart of Cambyses was touched for
once, and he ordered the Egyptian prince to be sought
and saved; but his mercy came too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Proceeding from Memphis to Sais, he broke open the
tomb of Amasis, the late king, and caused the body,
which was embalmed as usual, to be scourged, and insulted
in every possible way.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Finally, he ordered it to be
burnt, wherein he transgressed equally the religion of
the Persians and Egyptians. For the former say that it
is not fit to consign a dead man to a divinity, esteeming
fire as such; while the latter believe it to be a savage
animal, which consumes every thing within its reach,
and then dies; and consider it unlawful to let their
corpses be the prey of wild beasts. Hence the practice
of embalming, that worms may not prey upon their flesh.
This wanton and disgusting outrage was prompted by
personal hatred, arising from a slight said to have been
put upon him by Amasis, in consequence of which the
invasion of Egypt was undertaken.</p>

<p>That country being subdued, far from being contented
with his acquisitions, he now meditated three expeditions
at once: one against Carthage, which was frustrated by
the Ph&oelig;nicians, who composed the chief part of his
fleet, refusing to serve against their kinsmen and descendants;
another against the Ammonians, who lived in
the Libyan desert, in a spot made famous by the oracle
of Ammon;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> a third against the Æthiopians, called
Macrobii, or long&ndash;lived, who were said to be the tallest
and handsomest of all men, and to reach the age of 120
years and upwards. The monarchy was elective, and
they chose for their king whoever was most eminent for
strength and stature. Before he set out, Cambyses sent
spies into this country, charged with gifts and professions
of friendship, to which the Æthiopian replied, “The
king of Persia has not sent you with gifts, as setting a
high price on my alliance; and you speak falsely, for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
are come as spies of my realm. Neither is that man
upright, for then he would covet none other country
than his own, and not have enslaved those from whom
he has had no wrong. Give to him, then, this bow, and
say, ‘The king of the Æthiopians advises the king of
the Persians to invade the long&ndash;lived Æthiopians with
overpowering numbers, as soon as the Persians can draw
thus easily such bows as these; and, until then, to thank
the gods who have not inclined the sons of the Æthiopians
to add the lands of others to their own.’”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Cambyses, as we may suppose, flew into no small
passion at the receipt of such an answer, and urged his
march, says Herodotus, like one out of his right mind,
and too impetuously to wait until magazines could be
formed,&mdash;a precaution the more needful, because, according
to the prevalent notions of geography, he was going
to the uttermost parts of the earth. From Thebes he
detached 50,000 men to enslave the Ammonians, and
burn the temple of Ammon, while he advanced towards
Æthiopia with the rest: but before one&ndash;fifth of the
journey was accomplished, all their food was consumed,
even to the beasts of burden which attended the camp.
“If, when he found this out, he had changed his mind,
and brought home his army, then, bating the original
fault, he would have been a wise man. But, instead of
this, he pressed continually forward, without any consideration.”</p>

<p>The consequence of this improvident obstinacy was,
that his soldiers, who had lived on herbs so long as the
earth produced anything, began to live upon each other
when they reached the sandy desert. Cambyses had no
relish for this sort of supper, whether he was to eat, or,
like Polonius, to be eaten, and at length turned back,
not before he had lost a large part of his army. The
other detachment advanced deep into the desert, whence
they returned not, nor was it known what became of
them. The Ammonians said that a mighty south&ndash;west
wind had overwhelmed them with sand. The circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of their supposed destruction are powerfully
though rather extravagantly described by Darwin:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“Now o’er their head the whizzing whirlwinds breathe,<br />

<p class="p1">The king returned to Memphis, his army much weakened,
and his warlike ardour probably no less cooled, by
this double failure; for he made no more trials to extend
his empire. So humiliating a disappointment was not
likely to sweeten his arbitrary temper, and to its effects
we are inclined to attribute the sudden change which
appears to have taken place in his conduct. We say
appears, because up to this time nothing is related of his
private life: it is not probable, however, that the historian
would have omitted occurrences such as those which
characterise it from henceforward. The seeds of the
evil which now shot up had long been rooting themselves.
Self&ndash;gratification had been the end, and his
will the guide, of his actions; and on such persons uncontrolled
power acts like a hot&ndash;bed, to draw up their bad
qualities into tenfold rankness. Old tales make frequent
mention of magicians being torn in pieces by the spirits
whom they have called up. He who gives loose to the
evil passions of his nature, has a worse set of fiends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
deal with, than the grotesque imaginations of our forefathers
ever figured, and will find it harder to escape
from them in safety: what wonder is it if the reason
proves unequal to bear the shocks of such a warfare?
That the mind of Cambyses so yielded, the cruelty,
impiety, and extravagance of his latter years, in which
his conduct was as impolitic as wicked, will not allow us
to doubt. Disappointment and vexation could not have
produced the disorder, though they may have hastened
the crisis and increased its violence.</p>

<p>The Egyptians referred this change to another cause.
When Cambyses reached Memphis he found the city in
great joy. Apis,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> the sacred bull, one of their most
venerated deities, had just appeared, and, as usual, the
whole country celebrated it as a festival. The despot
suspected, not unnaturally, that they were rejoicing
over his defeat, and sent for the magistrates, to ask why
the Egyptians, who had done nothing of the sort when
he was before at Memphis, made such show of joy, now
that he came there after losing his army. They replied,
that their god, who was wont to appear at long intervals,
had manifested himself, and that on this occasion the
Egyptians always kept holiday. Cambyses said they
lied, and therefore sent them to execution. He next
sent for the priests, and being similarly answered, said
that he would soon know whether any tame god was
come among the Egyptians. At his command, the animal
was produced; he drew his dagger, struck Apis in
the thigh, and said, laughing, “Fools, are such things
gods, composed of flesh and blood and penetrable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
steel? He is indeed a god worthy of the Egyptians!
For you, you shall not make a mock of me with impunity.”
So saying, he ordered the priests to be scourged,
and all persons found celebrating the feast to be slain.
Apis died, and was buried secretly. From this sacrilege
the Egyptians dated the madness of Cambyses. Others
ascribed it to epilepsy, to which he is said to have been
subject from his birth. The disease might have produced
a liability to insanity, but it could scarcely have
been the agent in working so sudden a change. The extravagances
of Caligula, however, were referred by many
to the same cause.</p>

<p>The change in his temper was first shown by the murder
of his brother Smerdis, whom he had sent back to
Susa in a fit of jealousy because he was the only man in
the army who could draw the King of Ethiopia’s bow,
even for two fingers’ breadth. After taking this step,
he dreamed that a messenger came to him from Persia,
with tidings that Smerdis sat upon the throne, and
touched the heavens with his head. Fearing, therefore,
that this vision portended his being deposed and murdered,
he sent a trusty follower, named Prexaspes, to
Susa, with orders to assassinate his brother. The commission
was faithfully performed.</p>

<p>A sister also, who had followed him into Egypt, and
with whom he cohabited, fell a victim to his intemperate
passion. “Before this time,” Herodotus says, “the
Persians never married their sisters, but he, wishing to
do so, managed it thus. Knowing that he was about to
act contrary to their customs, he sent for the royal judges,
and asked them if there were any law permitting any one
who wished to cohabit with his sister. Now the royal
judges are select men among the Persians, who retain
their office during life, or till convicted of some injustice;
and it is they who preside in the Persian courts and interpret
the laws and institutions of the nation, and all
things are referred to them. So to this question of
Cambyses they returned an answer that was both just
and safe, saying that they could find no law permitting a
brother to marry his sister; but they had indeed discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
another&mdash;that it was lawful for the king of the
Persians to do whatever he liked. Thus, then, they did
not break the law from fear of Cambyses; and yet, lest
they should themselves perish out of regard for the law,
they found another law to help him in marrying his sister.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
Cambyses and his judges seem to have been
well suited. There is on record a better instance of
courtly evasion, related by Waller. The poet went, on
the day of a dissolution of parliament, to see the King,
James II., at dinner. “Dr. Andrews, Bishop of Winchester,
and Dr. Neal, Bishop of Durham, were standing
behind his majesty’s chair, and there happened something
in the conversation these prelates had with the
King on which Mr. Waller did often reflect. His majesty
asked the bishops, ‘My lords, cannot I take my
subjects’ money when I want it, without all this formality
in parliament?’ The Bishop of Durham readily
answered, ‘God forbid, sire, but you should! You are
the breath of our nostrils.’ Whereupon the King turned
and said to the Bishop of Winchester, ‘Well, my lord,
what say you?’ ‘Sire,’ replied the bishop, ‘I have no
skill to judge of parliamentary cases.’ The King replied,
‘No put&ndash;offs, my lord&mdash;answer me presently.’ ‘Then,
sire,’ said he, ‘I think it is lawful for you to take my
brother Neal’s money, for he offers it.’”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>It was another sister who followed Cambyses into
Egypt, and perished there by his violence. She was
present when he set a lion’s whelp to fight a puppy.
The latter had the worst, till another of the same litter
broke loose, and came to help it, when the two together
beat the lion. The princess shed tears at the sight, and
being questioned why she did so, replied that it was for
the remembrance of Smerdis, and the thought that there
was no one to avenge his death. The brute kicked her,
and thereby inflicted a mortal injury.</p>

<p>He held Prexaspes, the person employed to murder
Smerdis, in especial favour, and among other marks of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
appointed that nobleman’s son to be his cup&ndash;bearer. One
day he asked, “Prexaspes, what sort of person do the
Persians think me?” He replied with unseasonable
candour, “that they praised him very highly, only they
said that he was terribly fond of wine.” Cambyses was
very angry at the imputation. “Do the Persians,” he
answered, “say that I am beside myself for love of wine?
You shall see whether they speak the truth, or whether
it is they that are beside themselves when they talk thus.
If I cleave your son’s heart with my arrow as he stands
without the door, then the Persians will be proved to
talk nonsense: if I miss, then say that the Persians speak
truth, and it is I that am mad.” He drew his bow, the
boy fell, and he commanded that he should be opened:
the arrow was found fixed in his heart. He turned to
the father and said, laughing, “Prexaspes, I have made
it clear to you that the Persians are mad, and not I. Now
tell me whether you have seen any man who shot so
well?” The miserable wretch, fearing for his own
safety, replied that not even a god could have done so
well.</p>

<p>Cr&oelig;sus, who was kept in attendance in his court, as
before in Cyrus’s, ventured to remonstrate on the course
which he was pursuing, but so unsuccessfully, that nothing
but a rapid flight saved him from furnishing another
proof of Cambyses’ skill in archery. He was then
ordered to execution, but the officers who had charge of
him, knowing the value that their master set upon Cr&oelig;sus,
and expecting rewards for saving his life, concealed him
until the king’s anger should be over. One day at length
they produced him, when Cambyses was expressing his
regret for the Lydian’s death. It is dangerous to calculate
upon a madman’s conduct. The king said that he
was very glad Cr&oelig;sus was preserved, and put the officers
to death for disobeying his orders.</p>

<p>He had now been absent from Persia three years
nearly, when a revolt broke out; the natural consequence
of so long a desertion of the seat of empire,
especially under a despotic government; in which case
the people, habituated implicitly to submit to those in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
authority, care little from what head that authority emanates,
provided it is conveyed through the customary
channels. On leaving Persia, Cambyses had appointed
Patizeithes, a Magian, or one of the hereditary priesthood,
to be steward or inspector of the royal household.
This man probably possessed rank and influence, as,
under all monarchies, the nobility have been eager to fill
even menial offices about the royal person; perhaps his
station gave him political importance, as in France,
under the Merovingian dynasty, the Maires du Palais
wielded the whole power of the state. He had a brother
named Smerdis, closely resembling in person Smerdis
the son of Cyrus; and knowing both that the latter was
dead, and that the fact of his death was carefully concealed
from the nation, he conceived a plan, founded probably
on the reputed madness and necessary unpopularity
of Cambyses, for dethroning him, and substituting
his own brother as the son of Cyrus. The attempt
seems to have succeeded without opposition: for the
historian merely states that he set his brother on the
throne, and sent heralds throughout the empire, to say
that in future obedience was to be paid to Smerdis, son
of Cyrus, and not to Cambyses. The herald sent
into Egypt found the latter with his army in Syria, and
(a service of no small danger) boldly delivered his message
to the king in public. On this occasion the madman
behaved reasonably, for instead of killing Prexaspes
and the herald in the first instance, and then proceeding
to inquire how Smerdis came to be alive, he began by
investigating, and soon perceived the real state of the
case. The true meaning of the dream already referred
to then struck him, in which he saw a messenger from
Susa, who told him that Smerdis sat upon the throne, and
reached the heavens with his head. Some remnant of
kindly feeling and remorse now touched his heart, and
he wept to think that he had destroyed his brother to
no purpose; but this soon gave way to a natural anger,
and with his usual precipitation he would instantly have
departed to assert his own empire, and punish the conspirators.
But as he sprung to horse the button dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
off which closed the end of his scabbard; and the naked
point pierced his thigh, the spot in which he had sacrilegiously
wounded Apis. He thought that the injury
was mortal, and asked the name of the city where he
then was. It was called Ecbatana,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and in Ecbatana an
oracle had forewarned him he should die; but he naturally
interpreted it of the more celebrated Ecbatana,
the residence of the ancient Median kings. When he
heard the name he was sobered, and comprehending the
oracle aright, said “Here then Cambyses, son of Cyrus,
is destined to end his life.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The wound mortified, and
on the twentieth day after the accident he sent for the
most eminent of his countrymen, and addressed them in
these words: “Men of Persia, I am now forced to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to you what I have hitherto concealed most carefully.
For, being in Egypt, I saw in my sleep a vision which I
would fain never have seen, and thought a messenger
from home brought word that Smerdis sat upon the
throne, and reached the heavens with his head. Fearing,
therefore, to be deposed by my brother, I did more
hastily than wisely, for it is not in man’s nature to turn
aside that which is decreed: but I, fool as I was, sent
Prexaspes to Susa to kill Smerdis, and lived in security
when this great evil was done, never thinking that,
though he was removed, some other person might rise up
against me. And thus, being wrong concerning every
thing that was to happen, I have needlessly become a
fratricide, and yet am equally deprived of my kingdom.
For it was Smerdis, the Magian, whose revolt the divinity
foretold in my dream. The deed then is done, and
be assured that you have no longer Smerdis, son of Cyrus,
but the Magi fill the royal office; he whom I left
steward of my household, and Smerdis his brother. He
is dead, then, whose part especially it was to avenge the
wrongs done to me by the Magi; dead, impiously murdered
by his nearest of kin. And as he is no more, I am
compelled to give in charge to you, O Persians, those
things which at the end of life I wish to be done. I
require of you then, and call the gods of our empire to
witness, that you suffer not the sovereignty to revert to
the Medes, but if they have obtained it by fraud, by
fraud let them be stripped of it; if by force, by force
do you recover it. And as you do this, may your land
be fruitful, and your wives and flocks yield increase to
you as a free people for ever; but if you recover not
the empire, nor attempt to recover it, I imprecate upon
you the reverse of all these things, and further pray that
the end of every Persian may be like mine.” So saying,
he bewailed in tears his whole condition. And
when the Persians beheld their king weeping they rent
their clothes, and made lamentation unsparingly.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
died Cambyses, in the seventh year and fifth month of
his reign.</p>

<p>The Egyptians, who were horror&ndash;struck at the outrage
committed upon Apis, and who ascribed the atrocities
perpetrated by the Persian monarch to madness,
the consequence of this crime, saw in the manner of his
death a further manifestation of divine vengeance. Strange
inconsistency, that men should believe a deity unable to
protect his own person, and yet thus capable of inflicting
punishment upon his injurer! In a similar spirit, the
death of Cleomenes, King of Sparta, an event attended
with remarkable and impressive circumstances, was attributed
to no less than four different acts of impiety by
different parties, each believing that it was caused by an
infringement upon those things which they themselves
considered as peculiarly sacred. Cleomenes’ mind was
impaired before he ascended the throne, insomuch that
his younger brother endeavoured to set aside the strict
order of succession in his own favour. We may notice
this as a strong proof of what has been said of the
efficacy of moral restraint in preserving mental sanity,
and checking the progress of existing disease. The
strict discipline of Sparta, the subjection of her kings in
common with all other citizens, not merely to written
law, but to public opinion, was sufficient to restrain the
wanderings even of an impaired mind; for though his
reign was overbearing and violent, nothing is related of
him which can be considered as a proof of madness
until towards its close, when he became addicted to
drunkenness, a vice especially contrary to the Spartan
laws. Being proved to have bribed the priestess to
return an answer suitable to his own interests on one
occasion when the Spartan government consulted the
Delphic oracle, he fled to Thessaly, and from thence
to Arcadia, where he employed himself so successfully
in stirring up war against Sparta, that he was recalled
and reinstated. Shortly after he broke out into frenzy,
having been before, says Herodotus, somewhat crazed;
and being placed in confinement under the charge of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Helot, he obtained a sword from his guard, with which
he deliberately cut himself into pieces, beginning at the
legs and so proceeding upwards, until he reached the
vital parts, and died.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>That so tragical an end should excite general attention,
that it should be referred to the direct interposition
of the Deity to punish some crime, is no wonder: what
is chiefly observable, and characteristic of Grecian
religion, is that no one thought of attributing the anger
of the gods to moral guilt, of which Cleomenes had no
lack, but merely to some injury or insult offered especially
to the gods themselves. Hence, according to the religious
prepossessions of the party speculating, there were
four methods current of accounting for his madness.
Some time before, when commanding in an invasion of
Argolis, he had defeated the opposing army, and driven
many of them into a wood sacred to the hero Argus (not
he with the many eyes), from whom the Argians traced
their descent. Unwilling to lose his prey, he at first
enticed them one by one with promises of safety, and
when his treachery was discovered, and they refused to
quit their asylum, he caused the Helots attendant on the
army to surround the grove with dry wood, and burnt it
together with the wretches it contained. The Argians
then said that the hero Argus thus avenged the pollution
and destruction of his grove: the Athenians were equally
confident that he was thus afflicted because he had once
ravaged the sacred precincts of Eleusis: the other
Greeks, who cared comparatively little either for Argus
or Ceres, found a sufficient cause in his corruption of
the Delphian oracle, which was consulted and venerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
by all alike. And the Spartans, bigoted to nothing so
much as to their own institutions, probably stumbled
upon the truth when they said that there was nothing
divine about the business, but that he was driven mad
by hard drinking. A similar feeling led the royalists to
see something extraordinary in the death of Lord Brooke,
who was killed by a musket&ndash;shot in the eye, fired from
Lichfield Cathedral, while besieging it for the Parliament
in 1643. “There were many discourses and
observations upon his death, that it should be upon St.
Chad’s day, being the 2nd of March, by whose name,
he being a bishop shortly after the planting of Christianity
in this island, that church had anciently been called.
And it was reported that in his prayer that very morning
(for he used to pray publicly, though his chaplain
were in the presence), he wished ‘that if the cause he
were in were not right and just, he might presently be
cut off.’” Others went still further, and observed not
only that he was killed in attacking St. Chad’s church
on St. Chad’s day, but that he received his death&ndash;wound
in the very eye with which he had said he hoped to see
the ruin of all the cathedrals in the kingdom. It is observable
that the honour of the tutelary saint seems to have
been more thought of than that of the Deity.</p>

<p>C. Cæsar Caligula, son of Germanicus and Agrippina,
being left an orphan at an early age, passed under the
guardianship of his grand&ndash;uncle Tiberius, who adopted
and declared him his successor. In this critical situation
he profited so well by the admirable example of duplicity
ever before him, that neither the destruction of his nearest
relations, nor even the insults studiously offered to
himself, drew from him a complaint, or interrupted his
obsequious attentions to the reigning power. It was well
said after his accession, in reference to this period, that
there never was a better slave or a worse master. But
cruelty and licentiousness showed themselves through this
mask of milkiness; and the clear&ndash;sighted Tiberius, it is
said, often predicted that Caligula would live for his own
and all men’s perdition, and that he was cherishing a
serpent against the Roman people, and a Phaeton against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the whole world. If the speech be genuine, the emperor’s
kind intentions towards others merited that he should
be the first victim of his amiable pupil, and such was the
case. At the close of his last illness, while he lay in a
stupor which was supposed to be death, Macro, the favourite
minister, proclaimed Caligula. But he revived&mdash;his
courtiers slunk away from the new&ndash;made monarch, and
Caligula in passive terror awaited the consequences of his
precipitance, until Macro caused his reviving benefactor
to be smothered under the bed&ndash;clothes.</p>

<p>The news of a change of masters was received with
universal joy, partly from hatred to Tiberius, partly from
love to the family of Germanicus; and the early conduct
of the young prince was calculated to increase the general
attachment. He honoured the ashes of his mother
and brothers with a splendid funeral, remitted punishments,
discharged all criminal proceedings, professed to
have no ears for informers, watched over public morals
and the administration of justice, and in all things assumed
the semblance of a mild and conscientious monarch. But
this affectation of popularity lasted no longer than the
caprice or fear which produced it.</p>

<p>The extravagant folly of his nature broke out in the
assumption of divinity. This was no new pretension;
but he surpassed his predecessors in the extent and
absurdity of his claims. He mutilated without remorse
the products of Grecian art, by placing his own head upon
the images of the gods, without regard either to the
beauty or sanctity of the statues which he thus disfigured.
He built a temple in his own honour, appointed priests,
and laid down a ritual of sacrifice, including only those
birds which were most esteemed by the epicures of the
day. He assumed the title of Latian Jupiter, and completed
the mummery by pretending to hold secret conferences
with the Jupiter of the Capitol, in which he was
heard threatening to send him back to Greece in disgrace;
and was only mollified by the repeated entreaties of the
father of gods and men, who invited him to share his own
abode, the venerated Capitol.</p>

<p>The Jews of course did not acknowledge his divinity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
which angered him exceedingly, insomuch that he issued
an order to erect his own statue in the temple at Jerusalem.
At the intercession of Agrippa this edict was recalled,
but his anger against the nation still continued, and gave
rise to a very curious scene. A deputation of Jews had
gone to Rome in order to conduct a dispute between themselves
and the Alexandrians. Caligula appointed the
parties to come before him at a villa which he had ordered
to be thrown open for his inspection. On the introduction
of the Jews, “You,” he said, “are those fellows
who think me no god, though I am acknowledged to be
such by all men, and who confess none except that unpronounceable
one of yours;” and raising his hands towards
heaven, he uttered that word which it was not lawful to
hear, far less to speak. The Jews were in despair, while
their adversaries jumped and clapped their hands, and accumulated
the epithets of all the gods on Caligula. One of
them, to improve this advantage, said that the emperor
would detest the Jews still more if he knew that they
were the only people who had never sacrificed in his
behalf. The Jews all exclaimed that it was false&mdash;that
they had thrice offered hecatombs for his welfare. “Be
it so,” he answered; “what then? You sacrificed to
another, and not to me.” All this time he was running
over the whole house, up and down stairs, and dragging
the poor Jews after, who, besides being in mortal terror,
were exposed to the ridicule of all the court. Presently
he gave some orders about the building, and then turned
to them and said gravely, “But why do you not eat pork?”
This was another triumph for their adversaries, who
burst into such immoderate laughter that the courtiers
began to be shocked. The Jews answered, “that the
habits of nations varied. Some persons,” they added,
“do not eat lamb.” “They are right,” said the emperor,
“it is a tasteless meat.” At last he said, rather angrily,
“I should like to know on what plea you can justify
your city;” and as they entered into a long speech, he
ran over the house to give orders about the windows;
then returning, he asked again what they had to say, and
then, when they began their speech again, ran off to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at some pictures. Finally he sent them off, with the
observation, “These are not such bad fellows after all,
but they are great fools for not believing me to be a
god.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>No man ever spilt blood more lightly, with more refinement
in cruelty, or with less excuse. He had no
rivals to fear, no conspiracies to provoke him; but selfishness
seemed to have stifled every humane feeling, and to
have left him a prey to the guidance of his evil passions,
unrestrained by that natural abhorrence of blood which
few even of the worst entirely overcome. To relate
one half of his atrocities would weary and disgust
the reader: the few here given are selected to show how
closely levity was mingled with brutality. He asked
one who had been banished by Tiberius, how he employed
himself in exile. “I besought the gods that
Tiberius might perish, and you be emperor,” was
the courtly reply. Thinking that those whom he had
banished might be similarly employed, he sent persons
around the islands of the Mediterranean, the abodes
usually prescribed to those unhappy men, commissioned
to put all to death. Cowardly as cruel, he was conscious
that the prayer merited a hearing, and had
superstition to fear, though not religion to venerate or
obey. A civil officer of rank, resident for the sake of
his health in Anticyra (an island of the Ægean Sea, celebrated
for the growth of hellebore), requested the extension
of his leave of absence. Caligula answered,
“that blood&ndash;letting was necessary, where so long a
course of hellebore had failed,” and sent at the same
time an order for his execution. The joke, such as it
is, appears to have been the only provocation to this act.
Imperial wit need be brilliant if it is to be displayed at so
high a price. It was his frequent order to the executioner,
whose work he loved to superintend, “Strike so
that he may feel himself die.” When, by a mistake of
name, one man had suffered for another, he observed
that both deserved alike; and here he probably stumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
upon a truth. One of his exclamations is notorious:
“Oh that the Roman people had one neck!” In a
similar spirit he lamented that his reign was distinguished
by no public misfortunes&mdash;he should be forgotten in the
prosperity of the age. It was a mistaken diffidence: he
might have trusted in his own powers to avert such a
misfortune. Another source of bloodshed was his profuse
expenditure. Within a year he spent the treasure
left by Tiberius, amounting to twenty&ndash;two millions
sterling, and then supplied his extravagance by every
species of extortion. He abrogated the wills of some,
because of their ingratitude in not making his predecessor,
or himself, their heir; those of others he
annulled, because witnesses were found to say that they
had meant to do so; and having thus frightened many
into appointing him a legatee conjointly with their
friends and relations, he said that they were laughing at
him, to continue alive after making their wills, and sent
poisoned dishes to many of them. And being thus
callous, and boastfully indifferent to his subjects’ sufferings,
he chose to affect horror when in the savage sports
of the amphitheatre one gladiator killed five others, and
published an edict to express his abhorrence at the
cruelty of those who had endured such a sight.</p>

<p>One instance of his extortion we could pardon. After
an exhibition of gladiators, he caused the survivors to be
sold by auction. While so employed he observed that
one Aponius was dozing in his seat, and turning to the
auctioneer, desired him on no account to neglect the biddings
of the gentleman who was nodding to him from the
benches. Finally thirteen gladiators were knocked down
to the unconscious bidder for near 73,000<i>l.</i> Among
other equally honest and dignified ways of raising money,
he sold in Gaul the jewels, servants, and other property,
even the very children of his sisters; and he found this
so profitable, that he sent to Rome for the old furniture
of the palace, pressing all carriages, public and private,
for its conveyance, to the great inconvenience and even
distress of the capital. But the sale, we may suppose,
went off dully, for the emperor complained loudly of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
subjects’ avarice, who were not ashamed to be richer
than himself, and affected sorrow at being compelled to
alienate the imperial property.</p>

<p>The most ludicrous part of his life is the history of his
wars. Being told that his Batavian guards wanted recruiting,
he took a sudden whim to make a German
campaign, and set out with such speed that he arrived at
his head&ndash;quarters in Gaul before the troops could be
entirely collected. He now assumed the character of a
strict disciplinarian; broke those officers whom his own
causeless hurry had made too late; and mingling a due
attention to economy with his caprices, deprived 6000
veterans of the pensions due to them. He claimed the
conquest of Britain, on the ground of receiving homage
from an exiled prince of that island; and having sent a
pompous account of this magnificent acquisition to the
senate, he proceeded to the Rhine and even crossed it.
While marching through a defile, he heard some one
observe that the appearance of an enemy at that moment
would cause no little confusion. The notion of war in
earnest was too much for the descendant of Germanicus
and Drusus. He mounted his horse, hurried to recross
the river, and rather than wait until an obstructed bridge
could be cleared, was passed from hand to hand over the
heads of the crowd. Not finding, or rather not seeking
a real enemy, he made some Germans of his own army
conceal themselves in the forest, and while he was at
table caused the approach of an enemy to be hurriedly
announced. On this he rushed to horse, galloped with
his companions and part of his guard into the next wood,
erected a trophy in honour of his exploit, and quickly
returned to censure the cowardice of those who had refused
to share the danger of their prince. In a similar
spirit he sent away some hostages privately, then led the
hue and cry to overtake them, and brought them back
in fetters as deserters. But his most brilliant exploit
was that of giving battle to the ocean. He drew his
troops up in line upon the sea&ndash;shore, ranged his artillery,
machines for throwing large darts and stones, as if
against an enemy, and then, while all were wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
what folly would come next, commanded the soldiers to
fill their helmets and pockets with shells, calling them
the spoils of the ocean, due to the Capitol and the
palace. To celebrate this victory he built a lighthouse,
and distributed a hundred denarii to every soldier;
and then, as if he had surpassed all former instances
of liberality, “Depart,” he said, “depart happy
and rich.”</p>

<p>Such victories deserved a triumph, but there was some
difficulty in procuring proper ornaments for the ostentatious
ceremony: for his German victories had produced
no prisoners, and it does not appear to have occurred to
him that the ocean contained fish as well as shells. A
live porpoise would have formed a novel and appropriate
feature in the procession, and have done honour to his
own prowess and to the majesty of the empire. To
supply the deficiency he collected a number of Gauls,
distinguished by their stature and personal advantages,
caused them to let their hair grow, and to dye it red (the
characteristics of the German race), and even to learn the
German language, and to assume German names. Strange
mixture of vanity with disregard of his own character
and contempt of the public opinion! The slightest reflection
must have shown the futility of these pretences,
and the immeasurable littleness of his own behaviour.
But so long as he had the pleasure of wearing his
borrowed plumes, it seems to have mattered not that the
world knew them to be borrowed. In a similar spirit he
affected to wear the breast&ndash;plate of Alexander the
Great. What bitterer satire could his worst enemy
have devised?</p>

<p>The capricious variations of his temper exposed his
associates to constant danger. At one time he loved
company, at another solitude: sometimes the number of
petitions made him angry, and sometimes the want of
them. He undertook things in the greatest hurry, and
executed them with sluggish neglect. To flatter, or to
speak truth, was equally dangerous, for sometimes he
was in a humour for one and sometimes for the other;
so that those who had intercourse with him were equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
at a loss what to do or say, and thanked fortune rather
than prudence if they came off unhurt.</p>

<p>His private life was polluted by vice and intemperance
of every description. Cowardly as cruel, the report of
a rebellion among those Germans of whose conquest he
boasted, terrified him into preparing a refuge in his
transmarine dominions, lest, like the Cimbri of old, they
should force a passage into Italy. At a clap of thunder
he would close his eyes and cover his head, and in a
heavy storm the Latian Jupiter used to run under the bed,
to hide himself from his Capitoline brother. He usually
slept but three hours in the night, and that not calmly,
but agitated by strange visions: the rest he passed sitting
upon the bed, or traversing extensive colonnades,
impatiently calling for the return of day. Justice began
the work of retribution early, and he who troubled the
rest of all others was unable to find quiet for himself.
Among his other extraordinary qualities was a most insane
jealousy of the slightest advantages enjoyed by
others. He overthrew the statues of eminent men erected
by Augustus in the field of Mars, and forbade them to be
erected to any one in future except with his express
permission. He even thought of not allowing Homer to
be read: “Why not I, as well as Plato, who expelled
that poet from his republic?” and talked of weeding all
libraries of the writings and images of Virgil and Livy.
This folly he carried even to envying the personal
qualifications of his subjects, and being bald himself, he
sent the barber abroad to shave every good head of hair
that came in his way.</p>

<p>Little remains to complete the picture, but to say that
his tastes were low, as his character was brutish.
Passionately fond of theatrical entertainments and the
sports of the amphitheatre and circus, it was from the
profligate followers of these arts that he chose his favourites,
to whom, and to whom alone, he was devotedly
attached. The story of his meaning to appoint his horse
consul is well known: the brute would have done more
credit to the subordinate, than his master to the imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
dignity; but it is apocryphal. But besides a marble
stable and an ivory manger, indulgences to which so
dignified an animal might reasonably aspire, Caligula
assigned to him a house and establishment, that he might
entertain company more splendidly. We regret not to
know whether the senators or their horses were the objects
of this hospitality.</p>

<p>He was wont to say, that of all his qualities, he most
valued his firmness of purpose (<i>̓ αδιατρεψία</i>). The
judgment was in one sense correct: this was indeed the
predominant feature of his character. But it was the
firmness not of principle, not even of policy, but of
obstinate and entire selfishness, which regarded not the
weightiest interests of others when placed in opposition
to its caprices; of habitual self&ndash;indulgence, which
gratified the whim of the moment, alike careless of its
folly or of its guilt. At first he would not, in the end
he probably could not, control his passions; and this
inflexibility is the symptom of that mental disease which
we believe to originate in uncontrolled power. This plea
furnishes no particle of excuse for him, no more than
drunkenness for the excesses of the drunkard: in both
the loss of reason is a crime in itself, and in neither
probably is it ever so complete as to obliterate the perception
of right and wrong. Of genuine madness we
find no trace in his life. He appears to have been
subject to no delusions upon particular subjects, to no
access either of frenzy or melancholy. As a boy he, as
well as Cambyses, was subject to epileptic fits, which
were supposed to have impaired his mind; and he entertained,
it is said, doubts of his own sanity, and had
thoughts of submitting to a course of medicine for his
recovery. Others thought that a love potion, administered
by his wife to fix affection, had produced madness; but
the tenor of his life countenances neither supposition.
Folly, selfishness, cruelty, and the restlessness of a self&ndash;upbraiding
spirit cannot be allowed shelter under the
plea of insanity; and the mental weakness and incapacity
of self&ndash;control which arises from the habitual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
dominion of passion, is no less widely different in its
effects than in its origin from that which is dependent
upon physical causes.</p>

<p>He perished by domestic conspiracy, in the fourth
year of his reign and the twenty&ndash;ninth of his age. He
oppressed the people and the nobility with impunity:
he fell, when his jealous temper rendered him formidable
to his servants and favourites.</p>

<p>Paul, emperor of Russia, was the son of Catherine II.,
who, as is well known, murdered her husband Peter III.,
and took possession of his throne, which she retained
till death. She conceived a strong aversion for her son,
who was in consequence brought up in retirement, neglected,
and even exposed to want. When arrived at
manhood he was still forbidden to reside at court; his
children were taken away to be educated under the
empress’s care; he was studiously excluded from all
knowledge or participation in affairs of state; and even
denied permission to gratify his military taste by active
service. His mother’s object was at once to render him
unfit for empire, and to spread abroad the notion that he
was so; with the view of passing him entirely over in
favour of his son Alexander, whom in her will she appointed
to succeed to the throne. Paul seems to have
been naturally affectionate, methodical, a lover of justice,
temperate, even amidst the most consummate profligacy
ever witnessed in a court; but these good qualities were
stifled by the faults of his education. Privation, contumely,
and a constant sense of injury, soured his temper,
and rendered him distrustful and cruel, at the same time
that the enjoyment of a minor despotism made him
capricious and ungovernable; for he was the undisputed
master of his little court, and could vent upon others
the ill&ndash;humour inspired by his own crosses, unchecked
by the presence of a superior, or the influence of public
observation. He lived at the country palaces of Gatschina
and Paulowsky, surrounded by his household
officers and troops, and shunned by all others; devoted
to the minutiæ of military discipline, and employed
chiefly in reviewing his guards, for whom he devised a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
new system of dress and regulations, which it was afterwards
his great pride and pleasure to introduce into the
army at large. There was a long terrace at Paulowsky,
from which he could see all his sentinels, who were
stuck about wherever there was room for a sentry&ndash;box.
Here he used to promenade with an eye&ndash;glass, sending
orders from time to time to one man to open a button
more or less, to another to carry his musket higher or
lower, and sometimes trotting a quarter of a league to administer
a good caning with his own royal hand to one
soldier, or to bestow a rouble on another, as he was pleased
or displeased with his bearing.</p>

<p>One or two anecdotes of this part of his life will best
illustrate his temper. Travelling through a forest, with
marsh on each side of the road, he recollected some
reason for going back, and ordered the driver to turn.
He did not do so instantly, and Paul repeated the order.
“In a moment,” the man replied; “here the road is
too narrow.” Paul flew into a passion, jumped out of
the carriage, and called to an equerry to stop the driver
and chastise him. The equerry endeavoured to allay
the storm by assurances that the carriage would turn as
soon as possible. “You are a scoundrel as well as he,”
was the reply; “he shall turn even though he break my
neck: at all hazards he shall do as I bid, the moment I
give the order.” Meanwhile the coachman had done so,
but too late to save himself from a sound beating.</p>

<p>He ordered a horse that stumbled under him to be
starved. On the eighth day word was brought him of
the animal’s death; to which he merely answered,
“Good.” The same accident happened after his accession
in the streets of St. Petersburgh, on which he got off,
made his equerries hold a court&ndash;martial, and sentenced
the offending beast to receive a hundred blows with a
stick, which were immediately inflicted in presence of
the Czar and the people. Worse anecdotes might be
found. His passion for the strict observance of military
minutiæ has been mentioned. One day, as he exercised
his regiment of cuirassiers, an officer’s horse fell. Paul
ran to the spot in a fury: “Get up, you rascal!” “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
cannot, Sire&mdash;my leg is broken.” Paul spit upon him,
and walked away swearing.</p>

<p>Catherine, as before said, appointed Alexander her
successor by will. She had intrusted this important
document to Zoubow, her last favourite, who hastened
immediately upon her death, in the year 1796, to place
it in Paul’s hands. It is due to the late emperor to say,
that he never took any part in the measures adopted for
excluding his father, who succeeded to the vacant throne
without opposition. The Czar’s conduct towards his
family, on this occasion, does him honour: the more,
that under similar circumstances, few of his predecessors
would have hesitated to establish their power by the imprisonment
or death even of an involuntary rival. Instead
of using severity, he gave an affectionate reception
to his sons, who had been separated from him since
childhood, increased their revenues, and assured them
and the empress, to whom he had been a harsh and
capricious husband, of his love and protection; and at
the same time, with prudence commendable on his son’s
account no less than on his own, he provided employment
for Alexander which kept the prince near his person till
the critical time was over.</p>

<p>The court and city of St. Petersburgh, the whole
public of Russia, received with fear their new sovereign,
whose caprice and extravagance were well known; but
his first measures belied their expectation. He showed a
decent respect to his mother’s memory, though he fully
returned the hatred which she felt for him, retained her
ministers, whom he had no reason to love, and displayed
judgment and honesty in his first political measures,
until every body thought that a false estimate had been
formed of his character. This good sense and moderation
did not last long. His first step was to secure his
throne by incorporating with the royal guards his own
household troops, on whose fidelity he depended. The
latter, like the Prætorian bands of the Roman emperors,
were a highly privileged and powerful body, captains of
which held the rank of colonels of the line. Its officers
of course were chiefly of high rank, and many of them,
to the amount of some hundred, resigned their commissions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
angry at seeing men not of noble birth, perhaps
raised from the ranks, placed over their heads, or unwilling
to undergo the new and harassing discipline
which Paul introduced. The Czar became alarmed at
this general desertion, and, by way of conciliation,
issued an order that all who had resigned, or should
thereafter resign their commissions, should quit St.
Petersburgh within twenty&ndash;four hours. Many persons
transported suddenly without the barriers, and forbidden
to re&ndash;enter the city, and left on the high road, without
shelter or clothing fitted to protect them from the cold,
perished miserably for want of money to reach their
homes.</p>

<p>Paul came to the throne ambitious of signalizing himself
as a reformer, but his mind was far too confined to
perform so hard a task successfully. In the civil department,
he did little but reverse all that his mother had
done; in the military, his attention was confined to insignificant
details. His great object was to conform the
dress and exercise of the whole army to the model which
he had been so long and anxiously forming at Gatschina.
The very morning after his accession he commenced this
important task by establishing what he called his Wachtparade,
to which every morning he devoted three or four
hours. However severe the cold, he was still there,
dressed in a plain green uniform, with thick boots and a
large hat, for he placed his pride in bearing a Russian
winter without furs; stamping about to warm himself,
with his bald head bare and his snub&ndash;nose turned up to
the wind, one hand behind his back, and the other
beating time with his cane, and crying <i>Raz, dwa</i>&mdash;<i>Raz,
dwa</i>, one, two&mdash;one, two&mdash;surrounded by gouty old
generals, who dared neither to absent themselves nor to
dress warmer than their master. The old Russian uniform
was handsome, suited to the climate, and could be
put on in an instant: it consisted merely of a jacket and
large trousers, which enabled the wearer to protect himself
by any quantity of interior clothing, without injury
to uniformity of appearance. The hair was worn long,
and falling round the neck, so that it defended the ears
from cold. Paul introduced the old&ndash;fashioned German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
uniform, which every true Russian hated for its own
sake, and despised as holding the Germans in supreme
contempt; he encased their legs in long tight gaiters, made
them powder and curl their hair, and hung false pigtails
from their necks. Marshal Suvarof, on receiving orders
to introduce these changes, together with the measure
of the men’s curls and pigtails (for everything under
Paul was done by measure), observed that “hairpowder
was not gunpowder, nor curls cannon, nor pigtails
bayonets;” and this witticism is said to have cost
him his recall.</p>

<p>Not content with modelling the army after his own
notions of elegance, his meddling spirit exerted itself in
the most vexatious and tyrannical interferences with the
freedom of private life. The dress, the colour of carriages
and liveries, the method of harnessing horses,
everything was matter of rule, and woe to him who met
the Czar with anything about his equipage contrary to
etiquette. One day he saw Count Razumoffski’s sledge
standing in the street without the driver, and ordered it
to be immediately broken in pieces. It was of a blue
colour, and the servants wore red liveries: upon which
he issued a proclamation forbidding the use of blue
sledges and red liveries in any part of the empire. He
waged a crusade against round hats, which he thought a
mark of jacobinism, the object of his greatest hate and
fear. If any person appeared in one, it was taken from
his head by the police; if he resisted, he was well
beaten. The cocked hats in St. Petersburgh were of
course soon exhausted, and then round hats were metamorphosed
into three&ndash;cornered hats, by pinning up the
sides. The emperor himself is said to have stopped
persons and pinned up their hats with his royal hands,
to show his people how a loyal subject ought to
be dressed. An order against wearing boots with
coloured tops was no less rigorously enforced. The
police officers stopped a gentleman driving through the
streets in a pair. He remonstrated, and said he had no
others with him, and certainly would not cut off the tops
of those; upon which the officers, seizing each a leg as
he sat in his droski, pulled them off, and left him to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
barefoot home. Coming down a street, the emperor
saw a nobleman who had stopped to look at some workmen
planting trees by his order. “What are you
doing?” said he. “Merely seeing the men work,”
replied the nobleman. “Oh! is that your employment?
Take off his pelisse and give him a spade. There&mdash;now
work yourself!” Once, when he met an officer going
to the palace wrapped in his cloak, a servant following
with his sword, he gave the servant his master’s commission,
and reduced the officer to the ranks.</p>

<p>It was an ancient Russian usage that all who met the
Czar, male or female, should quit their carriage, be it in
mud or snow, to salute, and even to prostrate themselves
before him. Peter the Great used to cudgel soundly
any person who did so, and Catherine II. had abolished
the practice; but Paul revived it, and exacted its observance
most severely. Of course, amid a crowd of
carriages continually passing at full speed, it was easy to
neglect it, without intentional disrespect; but no such
excuse was admitted. A lady, wife of a general in the
army, hastening into St. Petersburgh, from the country,
to procure medical advice for her sick husband, passed
the Czar inadvertently, and was immediately arrested and
sent to prison. Alarm and anxiety threw her into a
burning fever, which terminated in madness; and her
husband died from the same causes, and for want of proper
care and attendance. On being presented to Paul,
it was necessary to drop plump on your knees, with force
enough to make the floor ring as if a musket had been
grounded, and to kiss his hand with energy sufficient to
certify to all present the honour which you had just enjoyed.
Prince George Galitzin was placed under arrest
for kissing his hand <i>too negligently</i>. When enraged he
lost all command of himself, which sometimes gave rise
to very curious scenes. In one of his furious passions,
flourishing his cane, he struck by accident the branch of
a large lustre and broke it; whereupon he commenced a
serious attack, from which he did not relax until he had
entirely demolished his brittle antagonist.</p>

<p>Under a sovereign of such a temper no man could feel
secure for an hour. The police kept strict watch over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the words, the actions, the correspondence of every one;
and the knout, exile to Siberia, or at the best deportation
without the frontiers, were unsparingly dealt out
for involuntary or chimerical offences: and suspected
persons were continually hurried out of the country without
time being allowed for the arrangement of their affairs,
and in ignorance at once of their offence and of
the nature of the intended punishment. Such a state of
things was not likely to last very long in Russia, with so
many examples to prove how easy the descent is from the
palace to the grave.</p>

<p>Towards the close of his reign his conduct became
more and more intolerable, and at last he took care to
advertise all Europe of his folly or madness, or both, by
inserting in the St. Petersburgh Gazette a notice to the
following effect: “That the Emperor of Russia, finding
that the powers of Europe cannot agree among themselves,
and being desirous to put an end to a war which
has desolated it for eleven years, intends to point out a
spot to which he will invite all the other sovereigns to
repair and fight in single combat, bringing with them as
seconds and esquires their most enlightened ministers
and able generals, such as Turgot, Pitt, Bernstorff, and
that the Emperor himself proposes being attended by Generals
Count Pahlen and Kutusoff.” This piece of extravagance
appears to have completed the disgust of the
nobility, and consummated his ruin.</p>

<p>A plot was formed, at the head of which was Count
Zoubow, the man to whom he had been indebted for
the important service of suppressing Catherine’s will.
Paul’s aversion to every thing which his mother had favoured
soon overcame his gratitude, and Zoubow was ordered
to quit the court, and reside upon his estates.
Fresh intrigues again brought him into favour, and the
first use he made of it was to plan the murder of his master.
He opened his mind gradually to other noblemen:
it was resolved, as private crime will often assume the
guise of public virtue, that the safety of the empire required
the deposition of Paul; and as there is but one
prison whose doors can never open to a dethroned monarch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
they resolved, in conformity with all Russian
precedent, to put him to death. The details of this
catastrophe are interesting, and, it is presumed, authentic
and accurate, since they were thus related to Mr.
Carr by an eye&ndash;witness, and therefore an agent in the
deed.</p>

<p>“The Emperor used to sleep in an outer apartment,
next the Empress’s, upon a sofa, in his boots and regimentals;
the other branches of the imperial family being
lodged in different parts of the same building. On the,
10th March, o.s. 1801, the day preceding the fatal night
(whether Paul’s apprehension, or anonymous information
suggested the idea, is not known), conceiving that a
storm was ready to burst upon him, he sent to Count
P&mdash;&mdash;, the governor of the city, one of the noblemen
who had resolved on his destruction. ‘I am informed,
P&mdash;&mdash;,’ said the Emperor, ‘that there is a conspiracy on
foot against me: do you think it necessary to take any
precaution?’ The Count, without betraying the least
emotion, replied, ‘Sire, do not suffer such apprehensions
to haunt your mind; if there were any combination
forming against your Majesty’s person, I am sure I should
be acquainted with it.’ ‘Then I am satisfied,’ said the
Emperor, and the governor withdrew. Before Paul retired
to rest, he unexpectedly expressed the most tender
solicitude for the Empress and his children, kissed them
with all the warmth of farewell fondness, and remained
with them longer than usual; and after he had visited the
sentinels at their different posts, he retired to his chamber,
where he had not long remained, before, under some colourable
pretext that satisfied the men, the guard was
changed by the officers who had the command for the
night, and were engaged in the confederacy. An hussar,
whom the Emperor had particularly honoured by his notice
and attention, always at night slept at his bed&ndash;room
door, in the antechamber. It was impossible to remove
this faithful soldier by any fair means. At this momentous
period, silence reigned through the palace, except
where it was disturbed by the pacing of the sentinels, or
at a distance by the murmurs of the Neva; and only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
few lights were to be seen distantly and irregularly
gleaming through the windows of this dark colossal abode.
In the dead of the night, Z&mdash;&mdash; and his friends, amounting
to eight or nine persons, passed the drawbridge,
easily ascended a private staircase which led directly to
the Emperor’s chamber, and met with no resistance till
they reached the anteroom, where the faithful hussar,
awakened by the noise, challenged them, and presented
his fusee. Much as they must have admired the brave
fidelity of the guard, neither time nor circumstances
would admit of an act of generosity which might have
endangered the whole plan. Z&mdash;&mdash; drew his sabre and
cut the poor fellow down. Paul, awakened by the noise,
sprung from his sofa; at this moment the whole party
rushed into the room: the unhappy sovereign, anticipating
their design, at first endeavoured to entrench himself
in the chairs and tables; then recovering, he assumed
a high tone, told them they were his prisoners,
and called on them to surrender. Finding that they
fixed their eyes steadily and fiercely on him, and continued
advancing towards him, he implored them to spare
his life, declared his consent instantly to relinquish the
sceptre, and to accept of any terms they would dictate.
In his raving he offered to make them princes, and to
give them estates, and titles, and orders, without end.
They now began to press upon him, when he made a
convulsive effort to reach the window; in the attempt he
failed, and indeed so high was it from the ground, that,
had he succeeded, the attempt would only have put an
end to his misery. In the effort, he very severely cut
his hand with the glass; and as they drew him back, he
grasped a chair, with which he felled one of the assailants,
and a desperate resistance took place. So great was
the noise, that, notwithstanding the massy walls and double
folding&ndash;doors which divided the apartment, the Empress
was disturbed, and began to cry for help, when a
voice whispered in her ear, and imperatively told her to
remain quiet, otherwise she would be put to instant death.
While the Emperor was thus making a last struggle, the
Prince Y&mdash;&mdash; struck him on one of his temples with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
fist, and laid him upon the floor: Paul, recovering from
the blow, again implored his life; at this moment the
heart of Z&mdash;&mdash; relented, and on being observed to
tremble and hesitate, a young Hanoverian resolutely exclaimed,
‘We have passed the Rubicon: if we spare his
life, before the setting of to&ndash;morrow’s sun we shall be his
victims.’ Upon which he took off his sash, turned it
twice round the naked neck of the Emperor, and giving
one end to Z&mdash;&mdash; and holding the other himself, they
pulled for a considerable time with all their force, until
their miserable sovereign was no more: they then retired
from the palace without the least molestation, and returned
to their respective homes.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>After the accession of the new emperor, Zoubow was
ordered not to approach the court, and Count P&mdash;&mdash;
was transferred from the government of St. Petersburgh
to that of Riga. No other notice was taken of the
actors in this tragedy. Whether this extraordinary lenity
is to be ascribed to fear, or to a sense of the necessity
of removing Paul from the throne (for the high
personal character of Alexander places him above the
suspicion of having been an accomplice), the late emperor
would better have consulted justice, the interests
of his throne, and his own reputation, if he had exacted
a severer retribution for the murder of a father and a
sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p class="pn">For nearly four centuries subsequent to the age of
Theseus, scarce any mention of Athens occurs in Grecian
history: a circumstance honourable to that city, as denoting
a long course of tranquil prosperity, and indicative
of candour and veracity in the writers, who were
content to relate the few incidents preserved by tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
without taxing their imaginations to cast a fabulous
splendour over an unknown period. The change of
dynasty in the person of Melanthus, and the more celebrated
devotion of his son Codrus,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> with the alterations
in the constitution subsequent to, and partly consequent
upon, the death of the latter, constitute the only remarkable
events during this long lapse of years; and when at
length her authentic history commences, it is in consequence
of the interruption of that happiness which we
are led to believe she so long enjoyed. Upon the death
of Codrus it was resolved that no living person could be
worthy to bear the title which he had borne, and his
son Medon was appointed chief magistrate, with the
title of Archon, or ruler. Twelve Archons followed in
hereditary succession, when a further change took place,
the office being made elective, and limited to the period
of ten years; and at the end of the seventh decennial
Archonship the duties of the office were divided between
nine persons annually elected. After this change, the
possession of political supremacy became an object of
strife to the Eupatridæ, or nobles, in whom all power
was vested: and the Alcmæonidæ, or descendants of
Alcmæon, the last hereditary Archon, secured the prize.
Cylon, a man eminent for rank and influence, bore their
superiority impatiently, and endeavoured by force of
arms to make himself master of the government. He
seized the citadel; but the people rose against him, and
being unprovided for a siege he sought safety in flight,
abandoning his followers to the rage of the adverse faction.
As their best hope, they took refuge at the altars,
where violence could not be offered to them without
incurring the guilt of sacrilege. Megacles, the head of
the Alcmæonidæ, was then Archon; and by his partisans,
some of the suppliants, induced to quit their refuge upon
condition of personal safety, were perfidiously executed;
others were put to death even at the dreaded altars of
the Eumenides.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Thus far there is nothing in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
occurrence to distinguish it from a hundred other instances
of perfidy and cruelty: it is to the remote consequences
that we wish to direct the reader’s attention.
The Athenians, without caring for the murder, were
deeply shocked at the sacrilege; insomuch that not long
after, when parties had changed place, it was decreed
that of those who had been concerned in it, all yet alive
should be condemned to banishment, and the bones of
the deceased be taken up and cast out of Attica. The
exiles afterwards returned; but, a prejudice long existed
against their posterity, which proved no ineffectual weapon
in political warfare, and twice furnished Sparta with
the means of embarrassing her enemy by requiring the
expulsion of some of the leading citizens of the state.
The demand was aptly met by recalling to mind two
similar transactions in which the principal families of
Sparta had been engaged, and bidding them set the example
of expiation.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> It appears, however, from Aristophanes
(unless the passage is merely a squib against
the Lacedæmonians) that the charge of being “one of
the polluted” had not, even after the lapse of one hundred
and sixty years, or more, lost all its influence.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>We have already mentioned that it was the insult
offered to the gods, rather than the crime against man,
which produced so deep a sensation. That the perpetrators
of a cruel and treacherous action should be regarded
with abhorrence, will not indeed surprise us: but
the lasting ban entailed upon their posterity is connected
with some remarkable tenets, and deserves a few words
in explanation. The Greeks were firm believers in the
doctrines of fatalism. Man, it was held, struggled in
vain to escape from the vortex of destiny; however
repugnant to his wishes, or abhorrent to his principles,
he was borne on to do or suffer that which was decreed,
by an irresistible force, against which even the immortal
gods contended in vain. A very curious passage to this
effect occurs in Herodotus. Cr&oelig;sus, after his defeat and
captivity, sent messengers to reproach the Delphian
oracle with misleading to ruin, by its false predictions,
one who had merited the favour of the god by the magnificence
of his offerings. The answer ran thus:&mdash;“It
is impossible even for a god to escape from fate. Cr&oelig;sus
but expiates the sin of his fifth ancestor,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> who, being in
the guard of the descendants of Hercules, in subservience
to a woman’s treachery, slew his master, and seized upon
a kingdom which belonged not to him. Fain would
Apollo have deferred the fall of Sardis until the time of
the sons of Cr&oelig;sus; but he could not turn aside the
Fates.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Here, coupled with the assertion of an immutable
destiny, we find the not unnatural deduction that the
crime of an ancestor entailed misfortune on his posterity:
but this doctrine was extended much farther, and it was
taught that deeds of extraordinary blackness introduced
a malignant demon into the family of the offender, which
empoisoned its prosperity, and hurried generations yet
unborn to inevitable guilt and ruin. The office of inflicting
this retribution was assigned with some degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
confusion and uncertainty to the Fates, “who follow up
the transgressions of gods and men,”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> to the Erinnyes,
or Furies, or to Nemesis, the personification of divine
displeasure. But when once these fearful visitants were
established in a house, that house was marked out for
misery and ruin. Such was the fate of the descendants
of Pelops and Labdacus, the royal families of Argos and
of Thebes, whose misfortunes have furnished a never&ndash;failing
theme to the Greek tragedians, who abound in
references<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> to the fatal curse upon these races.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> It is
from the presence of these dread ministers of wrath,
visible to her inspired eyes, that Cassandra draws her
fearful presages of evil in that scene, perhaps the grandest
in Grecian tragedy.</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“For never shall that bard, whose yelling notes<br />
In dismal accord pierce the affrighted ear,<br />
Forsake this house. The genius of the feast,<br />
Drunk with the blood of man, and fired from thence<br />
To bolder daring, ranges through the rooms<br />
Linked with his kindred furies: these possess<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>The mansion, and in horrid measures chaunt<br />
The first base deed; recording with abhorrence<br />
The adulterous lust which stained a brother’s bed.”<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p class="p1">So, after the catastrophe, the chorus refers to the same
cause the accumulated horrors and crimes which weigh
down the house of Atreus.</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“O thou demon, who dost fall<br />
On the high Tantalid hall,<br />
Well I know thee, mighty fiend,<br />
Who here dost ever wend,<br />
Haunting down the double line<br />
From father unto son!</p>

<p class="ppy4 p1">“<i>Clytem.</i>  Aye, now thy words have sense and grace,<br />
Calling on that thrice great fiend,<br />
The demon of this race,<br />
For ‘tis from him their bowels burn<br />
With rage of lapping blood;<br />
Ere the old grief has ceased to throb,<br />
Young gore comes on amain.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p class="p1">With such ideas concerning an avenging destiny, it is
no wonder that the Greeks shunned contact with the
inheritors of divine anger; and national prejudice might
be more strongly raised by the sacrilege of the Alcmæonidæ,
because many of the sufferers were slain at the
very altars of the Eumenides, to whom the punishment
of such deeds peculiarly belonged, and whose worship
had been introduced into Attica in amends for the
judicial sentence which delivered Orestes from their
power. In modern times an analogous persuasion concerning
the fortunes of particular families has prevailed;
in illustration of which we may cite the belief in the ill&ndash;luck
of the Stuarts, a belief almost justified by the series
of calamities and bloody deaths which beset the princes
of that house: and, indeed, this faith in the influence of
misconduct to produce hereditary misfortune has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
general in Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, and
probably in other countries where a vivid imagination is
found in union with no high degree of cultivation and
knowledge. In Ireland it is the popular creed, that an
estate gained by fraud brings a curse along with it<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> (to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
open force they seem to be more indulgent); that the
possessor becomes a doomed man, and neither he nor
his descendants prosper. In Scotland it was thought
that a pious parent entailed a blessing upon his offspring,
while the punishment of the wicked and oppressor, if
not immediately manifested upon himself, or his children,
yet surely descended even on succeeding generations.
This feeling extended to all classes; and a striking
instance of it is connected with the massacre of Glencoe,
the blackest incident in Scottish history. Colonel Campbell,
of Glenlyon, grandson of Glenlyon, who commanded
the military upon that fatal day, being with his
regiment at Havannah, was ordered to superintend the
execution of a soldier condemned to be shot. A reprieve
was sent, but with directions that no person was to be
told of it until the prisoner was on his knees prepared
to receive the volley, not even the firing party, who
were informed that the signal would be the waving of a
white handkerchief by the commanding officer. “When
all was prepared, and the prisoner in momentary expectation
of his fate, Colonel Campbell put his hand into
his pocket for the reprieve, and in pulling out the
packet, the white handkerchief accompanied it, and
catching the eyes of the party, they fired, and the unfortunate
prisoner was shot dead. The paper dropped
through Colonel Campbell’s fingers, and clapping his
hand to his forehead, he exclaimed, “The curse of God
and of Glencoe is here! I am an unfortunate, ruined
man.” He soon after retired from the service, not from
any reflection or reprimand on account of this melancholy
affair, for it was known to be entirely accidental. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
impression upon his mind, however, was never effaced.
Nor is the massacre, and the judgment which the people
believe has fallen on the descendants of the principal
actors in this tragedy, effaced from their recollection.
They carefully note, that while the family of the unfortunate
gentleman who suffered is still entire, and his
estate preserved in direct male succession to his posterity,
this is not the case with the family, posterity, and estate
of those who were the principals, promoters, and actors
in this black affair.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the strife of faction consequent upon
Cylon’s attempt, Athens was convulsed by discord between
the rich and poor, arising from the oppressive
rights possessed by creditors over the persons of their
debtors, and the difficulty experienced by indigent freemen
in supporting themselves by their own exertions,
in consequence of the general prevalence of slave labour.
Solon was appointed archon, with power to remodel the
constitution; and having done so, he quitted Athens,
and remained abroad, it is said, for ten years, the people
having engaged not to alter his institutions within that
time. But to put an end to faction was beyond his
power. The landholders of Attica were divided into
three parties, denominated from the lowlands, the highlands,
and the coast. The first consisted chiefly of
the nobility, the great proprietors; the second were a
poorer class, among whom the democratical interest
predominated; and the third, consisting in a great
degree of men engaged in trade, held an intermediate
station, both in circumstances and politics. Lycurgus
headed the first party; Megacles was chief of the third;
and during the absence of Solon, Pisistratus, with whom
we are more immediately concerned, advanced to eminence,
and assumed the direction of the second. Of
his early life few particulars have reached us; it is only
said that he was distinguished by eloquence and military
talents, which he displayed on different occasions in the
wars against Megara. Not long after Solon’s return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Pisistratus came in his chariot into the market&ndash;place,
complaining that, in consequence of the jealousy excited
by his support of the democratical interest, his
life had been attempted while he was on his road into
the country, in confirmation of which he exhibited
wounds upon his own person and upon his mules.
Whether the story were true or false, has been controverted,
and must remain a matter of opinion; but that it
was a fiction, seems to have been generally thought by
the ancient writers. At all events, the people believed
the tale, and a body of guards was decreed him, the
numbers of which were gradually augmented, until he
was enabled to gain possession of the Acropolis, or
citadel, and, in the language of Greece, became tyrant<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
of Athens.</p>

<p>Death and confiscation being the usual concomitants
of a Grecian revolution, it was a matter of course that
the leaders of the defeated party should consult their
safety by flight; and accordingly, Megacles, with the
other chiefs of the Alcmæonidæ, withdrew from Athens.
The terms on which he was invited to return, which
happened soon after, are curious and characteristic. He
was distinguished by victories gained in the public games
of Greece, and during his exile he had conquered in the
chariot&ndash;race at the Olympic festival. The condition of
his restoration was, that the glory of this success should
be ascribed to Pisistratus.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> It may be doubted, though
horse&ndash;racing in modern days, and chivalrous exercises in
the middle ages, have been cultivated with ardour by
men distinguished by birth and station, whether the
possession of the best horses in the world has at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
time since availed to procure the forgiveness of a political
enemy. But the high estimation of such honours forms
a striking feature in the Grecian character. We know
from Homer, that, long previous to the institution of
public games, princes contended with each other in
athletic exercises: and when stated times were set aside,
at which the flower of all Greece might vie in displaying
strength and activity under the sanction and with all the
pomp of religion, and the victor was rewarded by the
acclamations of his assembled countrymen, it is no wonder
that a nation highly imaginative and susceptible of
the love of fame should have been led to set an extravagant
price upon the superiority in qualities whose value
was in truth great in times when the arm of one man
was sufficient to decide a battle, but diminished proportionably
to the progress of art and science. The chariot&ndash;race
almost always formed a part of these games; and
naturally, for when warriors fought from chariots, the
possession of the best horses was a valuable distinction.
This method of warfare had been disused long before
the time of Pisistratus; but the chariot&ndash;race still formed
a part, perhaps the most important one, in the Grecian
games. And the welcome of a conquering general to
his native city was less distinguished than that of an
Olympic victor, whose prowess reflected honour upon
the state which gave him birth: and thus such triumphs,
by gratifying popular vanity, might become important,
even to the interests of a statesman.</p>

<p>The year 560 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> is fixed as that of Pisistratus’s usurpation.
The union of Megacles and Lycurgus produced
his expulsion, after he had possessed the tyranny, it is
thought, for about six years; of the transactions during
which we have no information. He remained in banishment
for an equal time, when the enmity between the
united factions broke out afresh, and Megacles, to establish
his superiority, brought back Pisistratus, connecting
their interests by giving him his daughter in marriage.
To gain the consent of the Athenians to his return, they
devised a plan, characterised by Herodotus, from whom
we have the story, as a most simple device to ensnare a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
people distinguished for intellect and very far removed
from a simple good&ndash;nature. In one of the boroughs of
Attica there lived a woman named Phya, of extraordinary
stature, and withal of handsome person, whom they
selected to personate the patron Goddess of Athens; and
having carefully instructed her how to act her part, they
dressed her in appropriate armour, placed her in a
chariot, and sent her into the city, preceded by heralds,
making proclamation, “O Athenians, receive with favour
Pisistratus, whom Athene,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> honouring him above all
men, herself brings back unto her own Acropolis.” The
news flew abroad throughout Attica, that Athene had
brought back Pisistratus, and those who were in the city,
believing that it was the Goddess, paid divine honours to
a mortal and received the exile.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>His prosperity, however, was of very short duration:
a domestic quarrel is said to have produced his expulsion
a second time, about a year after his return, and he remained
in banishment for a period of ten years, at the
end of which his son Hippias, who had now attained manhood,
induced him to attempt the recovery of his power.
Thebes, Argos, and other cities assisted him with loans,
by means of which he collected an army; and sailing
from Eretria, where he had fixed his abode, he disembarked
at Marathon, was joined by many of his countrymen,
and defeating the ruling party, for the third time
became master of Athens. Both now and formerly his
success was characterised by moderation and lenity; for
his only measure of precaution against future conspiracies
was to take as hostages the children of such of his
chief opponents as chose to remain in Athens, who were
committed to the charge of Lygdamis, the friendly ruler
of Naxos.</p>

<p>That Pisistratus’s temper and character were mild and
amiable, is proved by the bloodless nature of the revolutions
which he effected; and confirmed even by the testimony
of those authors who have endeavoured to raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the reputation of Solon at his expense, by narrating
many not very probable stories of the sage’s pertinacious
opposition to his schemes of advancement. That Solon
saw and lamented the ambition of Pisistratus is probable,
but we learn upon the same authority that they lived on
terms of intimacy and esteem from the return of the former
until his death; and Plutarch, whose object was to
exalt the patriot philosopher, has yet, in doing so, drawn
a most favourable picture of the tyrant. “He was
courteous, and marvellously faire spoken, and showed
himself beside very good and pitifull to the poore, and
temperate also to his enemies: further, if any good
quality were lacking in him, he did so finely counterfeit
it, that men imagined it was more in him, than in those
that naturally had it in them indeed. As, to be a quiet
man, no meddler, contented with his owne, aspiring no
higher, and hating those which would attempt to change
the present state of the Common Wealth, and would
practise any innovation. By this art, and fine manner
of his, he deceived the poore common people. Howbeit
Solon found him out straight, and saw the mark he
shot at: but yet hated him not at that time, and sought
still to win him, and bring him to reason, saying oft
times, both to himselfe and to others, that whoso could
pluck out of his head the worme of ambition, by which
he aspired to be the chiefest, and could heale him of his
greedy desire to rule, there could not be a man of more
virtue, nor a better citizen than he would prove.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> He
adds a strong testimony to the beneficent administration
of Pisistratus, in saying that Solon afterwards became
one of his council; and while Herodotus has distinctly
asserted that he ruled Athens honourably and
well, neither changing the magistracies nor altering the
laws, we learn from other authorities that he adhered to
the regulations of Solon. And it is to his credit that
he obeyed a citation to appear before the court of Areopagus,
on a charge of murder, even if we grant that he
ran little risk of being condemned; for it shows prudence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and good sense, and good feeling, that he chose
rather to wear the appearance of submission to authority,
than to outrage popular opinion by the visible assumption
of irresponsible power. Of his lenity towards
those who personally offended or injured him, several
stories are told. A young man who was attached to
his daughter, with the help of his friends carried her
off forcibly from a sacrifice upon the sea&ndash;shore, at which
she was assisting. Their galley was intercepted by Hippias,
who was then cruising in search of pirates, and
they were led captives to Athens. Being brought before
the injured father, they scorned to use the language
of entreaty, boldly declaring that they had held
death cheap from the time of undertaking the enterprise.
Pisistratus, struck with the high spirit of the youth, gave
his daughter in marriage to the principal, and thus converted
dangerous enemies into valuable and attached
friends.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The above extract from Plutarch bears witness
to his charity, which yet was not indiscriminate, nor
abused to the encouragement of idleness; against which
he not only enacted laws, but would inquire of any one
whom he saw unemployed in the market&ndash;place, whether
it were owing to the want of agricultural implements,
and if it were so, he would supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>In this, however, perhaps policy was as much concerned
as charity. Having obtained his power through
the support of the democratical party, it was now his
object to consolidate and establish it upon the downfall
of that interest, by removing the multitude as far as
possible from the city, and compelling them to follow
agricultural labour. Another reason might be the improvement
of the revenue, towards which he exacted
the tithes of all agricultural produce. A humorous
story is told of an old man, who was found by him cultivating
a stubborn and rocky piece of ground. “What
harvest can you derive from thence?” he said. “Aches
and blisters, and the tithe of them goes to Pisistratus.”
The answer was well received, and procured for him an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
immunity from the tax. On this subject, however,
Pisistratus’s conduct was generally unjust and oppressive,
for he not only forced the poorer Athenians to a rural
life, but excluded them from the city, and made them
wear a particular dress, that this exclusion might be the
better enforced.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> At the same time he proved himself
not indifferent to their interest, by appointing a public
provision for those who were wounded in the public
service.</p>

<p>It were much to be wished that our information concerning
the policy of Pisistratus and the public affairs of
Athens during his administration were more minute;
but the total silence of history concerning this period
indicates at least that it was one of tranquillity and happiness.
We have seen already that his private character
was amiable; it remains to be added that his tastes
were elegant and his mind cultivated. By many he is
included in the list of worthies distinguished as the
seven sages of Greece; indeed all writers who mention
him bear testimony to the successful cultivation of his
mental powers; and he possesses a strong claim to the
gratitude of the world at large, if it be true that he collected
and rendered into order the scattered fragments
of Homer’s poems before they were irretrievably corrupted
and confused by the inaccuracies of oral tradition.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
And he scarcely deserves less credit for having
been the first to establish a public library: an institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
most valuable in all ages and places, but especially before
the introduction of printing, when the price of books
rendered it impossible for any but the wealthy to possess
them. He also devoted much of his attention and
revenue to the embellishment of the city; he built fountains,
and a gymnasium, or place of exercise; he threw
his private gardens open to the public; he dedicated a
temple to the Pythian Apollo, and had commenced
another to Olympian Zeus, the Latin Jupiter, when his
labours were interrupted by death, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 527, after he
had enjoyed for ten years in tranquillity the sovereignty
which he had pursued for so many anxious years. He
left a name adorned by many virtues and accomplishments,
and blemished apparently only by one great fault,
ambition: but this, the master&ndash;passion of his life, has
sullied his numerous great and good qualities, as a tainted
fountain pollutes the whole stream. Had he been a
rightful sovereign, he might have been hailed as the
father of his country: instead of which his fellow&ndash;citizens
saw in him only the parent of a hated and proscribed
race, and later ages “damn him with the faint
praise” of being the best of tyrants.</p>

<p>His sons Hipparchus and Hippias<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> appear to have
succeeded quietly to his authority; which they shared in
common, Hipparchus filling the more prominent station.
Their father’s virtues descended to them, and Athens for
some time flourished under their guidance. The strong
expression of Plato is, that the Athenians lived as in old
times under the reign of Saturn. He goes on to say
that Hipparchus made the collection of Homer’s poems
which others have ascribed to Pisistratus, and caused
them to be publicly read in the order of their arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
at the Panathenaic festival; and further displayed
his taste in the patronage of Anacreon and Simonides,
whom he induced by his liberality to take up their abode
in Athens. And having thus provided for the mental
cultivation of the citizens, he turned his attention to the
improvement of the rustic population, and with this
view caused Hermæ<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> to be erected in the main streets
of the city and boroughs, upon which he inscribed in
verse the most pithy maxims which he had heard or
invented, that so the countrymen, wandering about,
might taste of his wisdom, and come from the fields and
woods to be further instructed in it. Two of these sentences
are preserved&mdash;“The memorial of Hipparchus.
Do not deceive a friend.” “The memorial of Hipparchus.
Depart, meditating justice.” Further, we
have the testimony of Thucydides, that he oppressed not
the many, but bore himself ever inoffensively, and that
“these tyrants held virtue and wisdom in great account
for a long time, and taking of the Athenians but a
twentieth part of their revenues, (they diminished,
therefore, Pisistratus’s impost by one half,) adorned the
city, managed their wars, and performed the rights of
their religion. In other points they were governed by the
laws formerly established, save that they took care ever
to prefer to the magistracy men of their own adherence.”
Thus fourteen years they ruled in peace and honour,
when at length a single act of oppression and insult, a
moment’s violation of the maxims of temperance and
virtue, which their conduct as well as their precepts
enforced, produced a revolution upon which probably
the destinies of all Greece have hinged.</p>

<p>Hipparchus had conceived a personal ill&ndash;will towards
an Athenian citizen named Harmodius, which he vented
by insulting publicly the offender’s sister. Another
citizen, Aristogiton, had reasons of his own for wishing
ill to Hipparchus: he stimulated his friend Harmodius
to a keener sense of the injury, and they resolved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
wash away their wrongs in blood. But few associates
were admitted to the knowledge of their plot, which was
to be executed at the Panathenaic festival, when it was
usual for all persons to appear in arms. Hipparchus
alone was personally offensive; but to dissolve the
tyranny, and to secure themselves from retribution,
Hippias was to be involved in his brother’s fate. On
the morning of the festival, while Hippias, attended by
his guards, was in the Ceramicus,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> ordering the procession,
Harmodius and Aristogiton saw one of the conspirators
conversing with him familiarly, “for Hippias
was accessible to all.” Thinking themselves betrayed,
they resolved, at least, to take vengeance on the more
obnoxious party, and hastened to seek Hipparchus,
whom they slew. Harmodius was slain in the tumult
which ensued. Aristogiton escaped for a time, but was
soon after taken and put to death.</p>

<p>The news being brought instantly to Hippias before
others had heard it, he dissembled his emotion, and bade
the citizens repair to a certain spot without their arms,
as if he wished to address them previous to the procession.
He then summoned his guard, and selected
from the assembled multitude all whom he suspected,
or found armed with daggers, a weapon not generally
worn by those celebrating the festival. Thus for the
present he preserved his power; but his temper was
changed by the danger which he had escaped, and his
government became jealous and intolerable. Many were
slain, and many fled to join the exiled Alemæonidæ,
whose cause became daily more popular at Athens, and
throughout the rest of Greece, until at length they gained
strength sufficient to enable them, with the assistance of
Lacedæmon, to lay siege to Hippias in Athens, in the
fourth year after the death of Hipparchus. The city,
however, was strong and well provisioned; and he
might have baffled their patience, but for a fortunate
chance which threw his children, with those of his leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
partisans, into the hands of the assailants. Parental
anxiety prevailed, and the town surrendered, on condition
that the obnoxious should receive no injury, but
should quit Attica within five days. Hippias retired to
Sigeum. When advanced in years, he accompanied the
armament of Darius in hope of recovering his sovereignty;
it was he that counselled its descent upon the plain of
Marathon, where once before he had landed under a
better star, and he is reported by Cicero to have been
slain in the memorable battle which ensued.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>After the expulsion of Hippias, the memory of Harmodius
and Aristogiton was hallowed by the Athenians
in every way which the imagination of a grateful people
could devise. Brazen statues were erected in honour of
them (by the side of which, in after&ndash;times, those of
Brutus and Cassius were placed), their descendants
were gifted in perpetuity with the privilege of eating in
the Prytaneum<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> at the public cost, with select places at
the public spectacles, and with immunity from taxes:
their names, forbidden to be borne by slaves, were
ordered to be celebrated at all future Panathenaic festivals:
and if the orators of Athens wished to find a theme
agreeable to national vanity, it was to the praises of the
tyrant&ndash;killers, or the events of the Persian war, that they
resorted. Yet, after all these tributes of admiration, it
is asserted by Æschines, that “a temperate and governed
feeling so modified the character of those benefactors of
the state, men supereminent in all virtues, that those
who have panegyrised their deeds do yet appear therein
to have fallen short of the things performed by them.”
This extravagant, or probably pretended, enthusiasm
may be endured, though not commended, as a privilege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
assumed by advocates and public speakers in all ages:
but we cannot extend the same toleration to Simonides,
who had benefited by the friendship and liberality of
the deceased, when he asserts “that a light broke upon
Athens when Harmodius and Aristogiton slew Hipparchus.”
Their exploit was a favourite subject of the
odes<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> with which the musical Athenians enlivened their
entertainments, one of which, composed by Callistratus,
has been preserved, and is esteemed among the noblest
specimens of the lyric muse of Greece.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">
I’ll wreath my sword in myrtle bough,<br />
The sword that laid the tyrant low,<br />
When patriots, burning to be free,<br />
To Athens gave equality.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">Harmodius, hail! though reft of breath,<br />
Thou ne’er shalt feel the stroke of death;<br />
The heroes’ happy isles<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> shall be<br />
The bright abode allotted thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">I’ll wreathe the sword in myrtle bough,<br />
The sword that laid Hipparchus low,<br />
When at Minerva’s adverse fane<br />
He knelt, and never rose again.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">While Freedom’s name is understood,<br />
You shall delight the wise and good;<br />
You dared to set your country free,<br />
And gave her laws equality.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Nevertheless there seems not to be the smallest ground
for supposing that the actors in this tragedy were guided
by patriotic motives. The authors who speak of it vary
somewhat in the circumstances which they relate, but
all agree that it was a private quarrel, a personal offence,
which inspired their resolution and their hatred. Many
have been the instances in which the wantonness of
power exercised on an individual has proved fatal to
men who have trampled unopposed upon the liberties of
their country, as if it were beneficially ordained that the
vices of individuals should work out the general good.</p>

<p>But though this conspiracy can in no respect be regarded
as the proximate cause of the re&ndash;establishment of
democracy; though neither its motives nor its effects, so
far as we can judge after the long lapse of ages, merit
the encomiums which have been showered on them so
profusely, it nevertheless affected vitally the interests of
Athens, and, through her, of the civilised world. The
mind need indeed be far&ndash;sighted and acute which presumes
to trace the changes which a single deviation from
the ordained course of events would have produced; yet
it is neither uninteresting nor uninstructive to consider
in what way a nation’s destiny might have been modified,
and to observe the natural connexion by which
crime results from intemperance and injustice, misfortune
and misconduct from crime; while the melancholy
series is still overruled to restore freedom to an injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
people, and to punish the ambition which produced such
fatal effects. From the apparently uninterrupted content
which prevailed at Athens during a period of
twenty&ndash;four years, from the last return of Pisistratus to
the death of Hipparchus, there is good reason to believe
that, but for private enmity, the brothers might
have borne uninterrupted sway for the natural period of
their lives. That of Hippias was prolonged for twenty&ndash;three
years; making a sufficient period in the whole to
have habituated the Athenians to usurpation, and to
have enabled him to transfer the sceptre to his children
as easily as he received it from his father. Athens,
thus converted, like the Ionian cities, into a tyranny,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
would probably have offered no more effectual progress
than they did to the Persian power, and without her
assistance all Greece would have fallen under the
dominion of the King.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> To pursue the subject further
would be both rash and useless: it is obvious that such
an event would have exercised a most powerful influence
over the subsequent history of mankind: to define that
influence would be difficult to the most penetrating and
comprehensive understanding, and the attempt would be
presumption here.</p>

<p>In the Italian republics of the middle ages we find
the age of Greece revived, though on a smaller scale
and with diminished splendour. They exhibit, in the
same colours the results of multiplying small independent
states, where every citizen may feel that he has
an individual as well as a general interest in public affairs,
and every city that she is concerned in the domestic
quarrels of her neighbours. The effects of such a system
are manifest alike in either country: the good, in the
remarkable number of distinguished men produced by
them; the bad, in the prevalence of external aggression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and internal discord, signalised alike by political acuteness,
unblushing profligacy, and revolting cruelty. Above
all, Florence and Athens are naturally associated by
their kindred eminence in art and literature; they were
alike distinguished for the mercurial temper and lively
imagination of their citizens, and political resemblances
are not wanting to complete the comparison. The early
changes in the Florentine constitution, the gradual depression
of the nobles, by the rise of the commons to
wealth and importance, their exclusion from public offices
and honours, the elevation of a plebeian aristocracy
upon the ruins of the feudal nobility, and the division
of the commons into an oligarchical and a democratical
party, are briefly and clearly related in Perceval’s History
of Italy, and may not inaptly be compared to the
gradual subversion of the Athenian Eupatridæ. Towards
the close of the fourteenth century, the oligarchy, headed
by the family of Albizzi, succeeded in obtaining possession
of the government, which it held for fifty years
with a mild and undisturbed sway. But their opponents,
though silent, were not crushed: as new families gained
wealth by trade, they grew impatient of political inferiority
and exclusion: and the Medici, one of the
most distinguished houses of the popular nobles, who
had long ranked in opposition to the Albizzi, were
naturally regarded as the stay of the democratic cause.
It was at this time that Cosmo de’ Medici appeared in
public life. The characters and adventures of this distinguished
man and of his immediate descendants offer
a singular number of coincidences with those of Pisistratus
and his family.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fifteenth century, Giovanni,
the father of Cosmo, was the most distinguished person
of his house and party. The great wealth which he
had acquired by commercial adventure was set off by
generosity and unblemished integrity: and though hereditarily
opposed to the ruling faction, his own disinclination
to interfere in politics, and the moderation of his
opponents, left him in undisturbed possession of his
riches and influence. To these his son Cosmo succeeded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and being possessed of greater talents and a more stirring
ambition, he took an active part in public life, and
became the recognised leader of the popular party.
The older heads, under whose temperate guidance Florence
had enjoyed a long interval of tranquillity, were
now deceased, and Rinaldo degl’Albizzi, a young man
of inferior judgment and stronger passions, had succeeded
to their influence. He observed and endeavoured to
check the growing spirit of discontent, and thereby
hastened a crisis which he was unprepared to meet.
By his machinations Cosmo was brought to trial upon
a frivolous and unfounded charge, and though his life,
which was aimed at, was preserved by a judicious bribe,
he was convicted and sentenced to banishment for ten
years. He quietly submitted to the decree, and retired
to Venice, where he was received with distinguished
honour: but Rinaldo had miscalculated his strength;
the next year a set of magistrates came into office who
were attached to the Medici, and by them the dominant
family was overthrown and expelled, and Cosmo triumphantly
recalled.</p>

<p>The youth then of Pisistratus and of the Florentine
commenced under the same political aspect, and was
marked by the same adventures; but the advantage thus
far is clearly on the side of the latter, who owed his
first elevation to hereditary distinction and to his own
merit, and his recall to the voice of his countrymen
constitutionally expressed. And the resemblance of
their youth holds good through their maturer years:
they alike retained their sway to the end of a prosperous
life, and alike employed it with beneficence and moderation;
for though the triumph of Cosmo was not
unstained by blood, and he hesitated not to ensure its
stability, when threatened, by the exile of his opponents
and the retrenchment of popular rights, yet his measures
seem dictated by prudence, not by revenge: they are
unpolluted by the atrocious cruelties so common in Italian
party contests, and Florence prospered, and was respected
under his administration. He avoided, even more than
Pisistratus, the ostentation of that power which it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
have been nobler not to have possessed; and presented
to the world the spectacle of a merchant raised to the
head of a powerful state, pursuing his original profession
with industry and success, and declining the alliance of
sovereigns to marry his children among his fellow&ndash;citizens,
whom he treated as if they were in reality, no less
than in appearance, his equals. No superior magnificence
distinguished his establishment or his table; but
his wealth was profusely employed in distributing favours
to all around him, until there was scarce a man of his
party who was not bound to him by some personal tie.
To this happy temper, and to the simplicity of his tastes
and manners, he owes the enviable reputation which he
has gained. Had he assumed the ostentation of a prince,
which his riches and power might well have warranted,
the obligations which he dispensed would have carried
with them the impress of servitude. But men forgive
injuries more easily than mortifications, and his fellow&ndash;citizens
reconciled themselves to the unconstitutional
superiority of one who treated them in every&ndash;day life as
his equals, or displayed his elevation only in the extent
of his generosity, and a freer cultivation and patronage
of all that is fascinating in art and literature.</p>

<p>We have described Cosmo de’ Medici as exercising
a power little less than regal in a republic whose magistrates
were changed every two months, and in which
he neither possessed ostensible office and authority, nor
that armed support which has often enabled usurpers to
dispense with all other title. The reader, therefore,
may be at a loss to understand the nature of his influence;
it is explained in the following passage. “The authority
which Cosmo and his descendants exercised in
Florence, during the sixteenth century, was of a very
peculiar nature, and consisted rather in a tacit influence
on their part, and a voluntary acquiescence on that of
the people, than in any prescribed or definite compact
between them. The form of government was ostensibly
a republic, and was directed by a government of ten
citizens, and a chief executive officer, called the gonfaloniere,
or standard&ndash;bearer, who was chosen every two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
months. Under this establishment the citizens imagined
they enjoyed the full exercise of their liberties; but
such was the power of the Medici, that they generally
either assumed to themselves the first offices of the state,
or nominated such persons as they thought proper to
those employments. In this, however, they paid great
respect to popular opinion. That opposition of interests,
so generally apparent between the people and their
rulers, was at this time scarcely perceived at Florence,
where superior qualifications and industry were the
surest recommendations to public authority and favour;
and, satisfied that they could at any time withdraw
themselves from a connexion that exacted no engagements,
and required only a temporary acquiescence,
the Florentines considered the Medici as the fathers,
and not the rulers of the republic. On the other hand,
the chiefs of this house, by appearing rather to decline
than to court the honours bestowed upon them, and by a
singular moderation in the use of them when obtained,
were careful to maintain the character of simple citizens
of Florence, and servants of the state. An interchange
of reciprocal good offices was the only tie by which the
Florentines and the Medici were bound, and perhaps
the long continuance of their connexion may be attributed
to the very circumstance of its being in the power of
either of the parties at any time to have dissolved it.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
The state of things described in a former part of this
passage corresponds with what the Greeks called tyranny,
and in the same sense in which Pisistratus was tyrant of
Athens, Cosmo and Lorenzo de’ Medici were tyrants of
Florence. But in his remarks upon the nature of their
power, Mr. Roscoe’s partialities appear to have led him
astray. The Medici, from their brilliant qualities, were
possessed of the affections of a large portion of their
countrymen, and it so chanced, therefore, that the one
were as ready to submit as the other to command. But
it will scarcely be believed that the connexion with a
family which had usurped the entire command of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
state, the sole disposal of the magistracies, could have
been dissolved at any time; or indeed that it could ever
have been dissolved, except by force of arms: and the
praise of moderation, however applicable to the two
elder Medici, is scarcely due to Lorenzo, who abolished
even the shadow of a popular magistracy, and asserted
the dependence of all functionaries upon himself,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> whose
expenditure was upon a scale of regal extravagance, and
who made his country bankrupt to prevent the bankruptcy
of his house. For he carried on the vast commercial
establishment by which his grandfather Cosmo
had acquired wealth; but with such different success,
that he was compelled to debase the national currency
to raise means for meeting his mercantile engagements.</p>

<p>Cosmo, resembling Pisistratus in the elegance of his
taste, lived, like him, at a time which enabled him to
confer singular benefits upon society. To the Athenian
we probably owe the preservation of Homer’s poems in
a connected form; to the Florentine and to his family
we are mainly indebted for those treasures of ancient
literature which time has spared; which, four centuries
ago, were rapidly decaying in obscurity, or, by a more
ignoble fate, were defaced to make room for lying legends
and scholastic quibbles, until, early in the fifteenth century,
a few enlightened spirits eagerly devoted themselves
to rescuing what still remained. The vast wealth
of Cosmo and his extensive correspondence were ever
ready to be employed in the service of learning; at the
request of the men of letters, by whom he loved to be
surrounded, his agents were continually charged to buy
or to have copied whatever manuscripts could be found
in Europe or Asia; he founded public libraries, and
among them that which is still named after his grandson,
the Laurentian, and supported the cause of literature
by affording countenance to all who cultivated it
with success. His mansions were filled with gems,
statues, and paintings, the master&ndash;pieces of ancient and
modern art, and he was the friend no less than the protector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of Donatello and Masaccio, to whom sculpture
and painting respectively are much indebted for their
rapid advance. Nor was he so much absorbed by these
tastes, or by affairs of state, as to neglect his domestic
concerns, and the flourishing condition of his estates of
Careggi and Caffagiuolo bore witness to his skill and
attention to agriculture, as did his foreign dealings to his
mercantile knowledge and success.</p>

<p>Architecture, however, was his favourite pursuit. Like
Pisistratus, he spent vast sums in ornamenting his city,
and if his glory as a patron of the art be inferior to that
of Pericles&mdash;if he cannot boast, like Augustus, that he
found Florence of brick, and left it of marble, he has
one claim to our praise which neither they nor probably
any other public improver of ancient or modern times
has possessed, namely, that the expenses of his works
were defrayed from his private fortune. It appears from
a memorandum of his grandson, Lorenzo, that in thirty&ndash;seven
years their house had spent in buildings, charities,
and contributions to the state, no less than 663,755
golden florins, equivalent to more than 1,300,000<i>l.</i> of
the present day. The magnificent edifice known as the
Riccardi palace was built by Michelozzi for Cosmo’s residence;
under his patronage the dome of the Florentine
cathedral was reared; he built churches and convents,
the enumeration of which would be tedious, and erected
a palace upon each of his four country estates. To
these retreats he betook himself in his declining years,
and, estranged from politics and surrounded by men of
letters, he passed the evening of his life in tranquillity,
unmolested by any enemy except the gout. Its close
alone was clouded by the death of his younger son,
whom he regarded as the destined supporter of his name
and grandeur, for the bad health of the elder incapacitated
him for an active life; and the aged statesman, as
he was carried through the vast palace which he had no
longer strength to traverse on foot, exclaimed with a
sigh, “This house is too large for so small a family.”
He died within a year of his son, in 1464, loved by his
friends, and regretted even by his enemies, who dreaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the rapacity of his partisans when restrained no longer
by the probity and moderation of their chief; and
Florence bore the best witness to his virtues, when
she inscribed on his tomb the title of Father of his
Country.</p>

<p>Piero de’ Medici, his eldest son, in name succeeded
to his father’s influence; but owing to his infirmities he
resided chiefly in the country, while, under shelter of
the respected name of Medici, a few citizens monopolized
the administration of justice and the management of the
state, and converted both to their own private and corrupt
emolument. He died in 1469, leaving two sons,
Lorenzo, named the Magnificent, and Giuliano; the
former being less than twenty&ndash;one years of age, and
the latter five years his junior. Had the Florentines
still been animated by their ancient spirit, there was
now a most favourable opportunity for the recovery of
liberty: but, under various pretexts, most of the distinguished
families under whom the people might have
ranked themselves had been driven into exile, and the
personal virtues of Cosmo, and his unquestioned pre&ndash;eminence
as a party leader, had laid the foundations of
an hereditary influence, and prepared a way for the entire
change of the constitution. So fully was the predominant
party aware of this, that the men who had
ruled Florence in the name of Piero, but without reference
to his will, and who had embittered the close of
his life by their profligacy and corruption, instead of
profiting by the youth of his sons to shake off this nominal
subjection, were eager to ascribe to them a power
which they did not possess. They took measures to
continue, under an empty name, a junto which assured
to them the distribution of all places and the disposal
of the revenue. The ambassadors who had been used
to treat with Thomas Soderini, the citizens who had
long been aware that their fortunes depended on his
favour, hastened to visit him, upon the death of Piero.
But Soderini feared to rouse the jealousy of his associates,
and to weaken his party by accepting these marks of
respect. He sent the citizens who waited on him to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
young Medici, as the only chiefs of the state; he assembled
the men of most importance, and presenting Lorenzo
and his brother, advised them to preserve to those
young men the credit which their house had enjoyed
during thirty&ndash;five years, and suggested that it was far
easier to maintain a power already strengthened by time
than to found a new one.</p>

<p>The Medici received with modesty the marks of
attachment and respect which were paid to them in the
name of the commonwealth, and for several years they
did not endeavour to assume an authority which ostensibly
was centred in the magistrates alone, and which could
not be exerted in secret, except by men whose long
services and known abilities ensured attention. For
seven years Florence enjoyed domestic peace; the Medici,
divided between their studies and the tastes of youth,
at one time entertained men the most distinguished in
art and letters, at another amused the people with brilliant
spectacles. But as they advanced to manhood, and took
the administration into their own hands, their rule became
more absolute, and their innovations on the constitution
more obvious. They appointed a body of five
electors, who named the magistracy without any reference
to the people: they converted the <i>balia</i><a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> into a permanent
council, in whose hands they placed the legislative, the
administrative, and judicial power; and by its means
they got rid of their enemies without legal proceedings,
imposed new taxes at pleasure, and diverted the revenue
to the maintenance of their commercial credit and the
support of their luxury. Unwilling that any should
enjoy consideration, excepting as it was derived from his
own influence and favour, Lorenzo excluded from office,
and depressed to the utmost of his power, all those
whose rivalry seemed most to be feared, but especially
the Pazzi, one of the noblest and most powerful families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of the state. At this period it contained nine men of
mature age, and of the first rank in the city: yet since
the death of Piero, but one of its members had been
admitted to the magistracy. This exclusion was the
more offensive because one of them had married Bianca,
the sister of the Medici. Giuliano, whose temper was
less ambitious, as his talents were inferior to his brother’s,
expressed his dissatisfaction at this conduct, and said to
his brother, that he feared they should lose what they
had by grasping at too much. It was believed also
that Lorenzo had interfered with the course of justice to
deprive Giovanni de’ Pazzi of a rich inheritance which
was justly his due; and Francesco, one of the brothers&ndash;in&ndash;law
of Bianca, a man of violent and haughty temper,
withdrew from Florence, and established a bank at
Rome.</p>

<p>Sixtus IV., the reigning Pope, nourished also an
inveterate hatred against the Medici, and under his
auspices a conspiracy was formed to murder them and
place Florence under the power of the Pazzi, in which
Francesco Pazzi and Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa, were
the chief actors.
<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
“The design of the conspirators was to assassinate
both the brothers, Lorenzo and Giuliano, at the same
instant, for the murder of one would otherwise only have
the effect of putting the other on his guard.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
therefore wrote to the Cardinal Riario, nephew of Count
Girolamo, a youth of only eighteen years of age, whom
he had just admitted into the sacred college, and who
was then studying at the University of Pisa, to desire
him to obey whatever directions he should receive from
the Archbishop of Pisa; and Salviati accordingly carried
him to a seat of the Pazzi near Florence. The conspirators
knew that the new Cardinal must be welcomed
with public entertainments, at which they hoped that
the Medici might be found present together, and despatched
while unsuspicious of danger. Jacopo de’
Pazzi gave a fête, to which both the brothers were accordingly
invited: Lorenzo, however, alone came, for
Giuliano was indisposed. But Lorenzo, as had been
foreseen, made sumptuous preparations to receive the
Cardinal at his villa at Fiesole; and there the conspirators
fully resolved to execute their purpose. The entertainment
took place, but still Giuliano was absent;
and the Pazzi, thus again disappointed, and despairing
of securing the presence of the younger Medici, at a
second festival to be given by his brother, resolved to
defer their enterprise no longer than the following Sunday,
when the Cardinal was to be present at high mass
at the cathedral of Florence; an occasion at which it
was thought that neither of the Medici could with decency
absent himself. There it was determined that, in
the midst of the most solemn offices of religion, the
crime of assassination should be perpetrated; that the
elevation of the host, as the kneeling victims bowed
their heads, should be the signal of murder; and that at
the moment of the sacrifice, the Archbishop Salviati and
others should seize the palace of the signiory, while Jacopo
de’ Pazzi was to raise the city by the cry of liberty.
Francesco de’ Pazzi charged himself, together with Bernardo
Bandini, a daring and devoted partisan of his
house, with the assassination of Giuliano. Giovanni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Battista Montesecco, a condottiere in the papal service,
had boldly engaged with his single hand to despatch
Lorenzo, while he understood that the murder was to
take place at a festival. But when Montesecco found
that it was before the altar of God that it was intended
he should shed the blood of a man whose hospitality he
had enjoyed, his courage failed him. The soldier declared
that he dared not add sacrilege to murder and
perfidy; and his office was committed to two ecclesiastics,
who had not the same scruples.</p>

<p>“When the appointed morning arrived, the Cardinal
Riario and Lorenzo de’ Medici were already at the
cathedral, the church was rapidly filling with people,
and still Giuliano de’ Medici did not appear. The conspirators
began to dread another disappointment, and
Francesco de’ Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini left the
cathedral to seek for him, and to persuade him that his
absence would be insidiously remarked. Every feeling
which revolts at murder and treachery is strengthened,
when we learn the terms of familiarity on which these
men had just been living with him whom they were
hurrying to death. They passed their arms round his
waist, as if to draw him in playful violence towards the
church, but in reality to feel whether he had put on his
cuirass, which he wore with habitual timidity under his
garments. But Giuliano was indisposed; he had discarded
his armour; and so unsuspicious was he at that
hour of impending evil, that he even left at home the
dagger which usually hung at his side. As he entered
the church and approached the altar, the two conspirators
kept close to him; the two priestly assassins had
also fixed themselves in the throng beside Lorenzo; and
when the host was raised, and every knee was bending
in adoration, Bandini struck his dagger into the breast
of Giuliano. The victim staggered and fell, and Francesco
de’ Pazzi threw himself upon him, with such blind
fury, that besides inflicting on him several blows with
his dagger, the least a death, he grievously wounded
himself in the thigh. At the same moment the two
priests attacked Lorenzo. One of them struck at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
throat, but missed his aim; and the blow, which grazed
the intended victim’s neck, merely startled him to his
defence.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Rapidly throwing his cloak about his left arm
for a shield, he drew his sword and courageously defended
himself until his attendants came to his aid. The priests
then lost courage and fled: but Bandini, his dagger reeking
with the blood of Giuliano, now endeavoured to rush
upon Lorenzo, and stabbed one of his train to the heart,
who interposed to defend him. Lorenzo, however, was
by this time surrounded by his friends, who hastily sought
refuge with him in the sacristy, and closed its brazen
doors. Meanwhile the whole church was filled with
consternation; and the first moment of surprise and
alarm had no sooner passed, than the friends of the Medici
collected from all quarters, and conveyed Lorenzo in
safety to his palace.</p>

<p>“During this scene in the cathedral, the Archbishop
Salviati, with a strong band of conspirators, attempted,
as had been concerted, to seize the palace of the signiory
and the persons of the magistrates. After filling the
outer apartments with his followers, the archbishop obtained
by his rank an easy admission to the presence of
the gonfaloniere and priors who were sitting. But instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of immediately attacking them he hesitated; and
his manner betrayed so much confusion, that the suspicion
of the gonfaloniere being excited, he rushed from
the hall and assembled the guards and servants of the
palace. The doors were secured, and the conspirators were
furiously assaulted by the magistrates and their attendants
with such motley weapons and instruments as the
furniture of the palace afforded. Dispersed and intimidated,
they made but a feeble resistance, and were all
either slaughtered on the spot, hurled from the windows,
or made prisoners. Jacopo de’ Pazzi, followed by
a troop of soldiery, attempted to succour them, after an
abortive effort to excite the citizens to revolt by crying
liberty through the streets. But the magistrates held
the palace until numerous citizens came to their aid, and
Jacopo, seeing that the game was lost, fled into the
country.</p>

<p>“The fate of most of the conspirators was not long
delayed. The Archbishop Salviati was hanged from a
window of the public palace, even in his prelatical robes.
Francesco de’ Pazzi, who, exhausted by loss of blood
from his self&ndash;inflicted wound, had been obliged to confine
himself to his uncle’s house, was dragged from his
bed, and suspended from the same place of execution.
Jacopo himself, being discovered and arrested in the
country by the peasantry, was brought into the city a
few days afterwards, and similarly executed, with another
of his nephews, whose knowledge of the conspiracy was
his only crime, for he had refused to engage in it: and
the whole of the devoted family of the Pazzi were condemned
to exile, except Guglielmo, the brother&ndash;in&ndash;law
of Lorenzo. The priests who had attacked Lorenzo, the
condottiere Montesecco, and above seventy inferior
persons besides, suffered death; and even Bernardo
Bandini, though he escaped for a time to Constantinople,
paid the forfeit of his crimes; for Lorenzo had sufficient
interest with Mahomet II. to cause him to be seized and
sent to Florence for execution. The young Cardinal
Riario, rather an instrument than an accomplice in the
conspiracy, was with difficulty saved by Lorenzo from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
being torn to pieces by the fury of the Florentine mob;
but his attendants were mercilessly butchered by them.”</p>

<p>The conspiracy of the Pazzi strikingly displayed the
absoluteness of the Medician dominion over the will and
affections of the people of Florence. So far from shewing
any disposition to join the Pazzi in revolt, the populace
were filled with grief and fury at the murder of
Giuliano, and at the peril in which Lorenzo had stood.
They had flown to arms to defend the Medici: and they
paraded Florence for whole days to commit every outrage
upon the dead bodies of the conspirators which still
defiled the streets. The cry of “Palle, Palle!” the
armorial device of the Medici,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> continually resounded
through the city; and the memory of the tragedy
wherein Giuliano had fallen, was always associated in the
public mind with a deepened and affectionate interest
for the safety of Lorenzo, and with an attachment to his
person which lasted to his death.</p>

<p>We might perhaps search history in vain to find two
families, whose fortunes, whose dispositions, and even
whose tastes were so faithfully reflected in each other,
as those of Pisistratus and Cosmo de’ Medici. If we
consider the younger Medici as immediately succeeding
to their grandfather (and the concession is not important,
for in the interval no political changes occurred in
Florence), the resemblance between their fortunes, so
far as we have traced them, is perfect. The founders
of either house, after similar reverses, established tyrannies
in their native cities, and yet lived and died beloved
and respected by their countrymen, and delivered their
usurped sovereignty peaceably to their successors. These
successors were in either case two brothers, who instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of running the usual course of jealousy and discord, exercised
their joint power for years in harmony, and were
at length separated by conspiracies which succeeded
against the one, only to render more despotic the sway
of the other. With respect to personal character, the
resemblance between Pisistratus and Cosmo de’ Medici
has been fully dwelt upon. That between the brothers
their descendants is necessarily less completely made
out, for we know very little of the political conduct of
the two Athenians; but we may observe the same
hereditary love of art and literature, the same absence
of jealousy, and the same superiority of one brother
over the other in the cultivation of learning. The resemblance
of their histories, so far as we have traced
that of the Medici, fails only in one respect: the
death of Hipparchus was due to his own intemperance,
the murder of Giuliano de’ Medici to the arbitrary
measures of his brother.</p>

<p class="pch">Invasion of Scythia by Darius&mdash;Destruction of Crassus and
his army by the Parthians&mdash;Retreat of Antony&mdash;Retreat
and death of Julian&mdash;Retreat from Moscow.</p>

<p class="pn">Darius, son of Hystaspes, having gained possession of
the vast empire which had been established by Cyrus,
devoted his attention to the regulation of its internal
policy: a task which we are led to believe he exercised
with moderation and judgment. But the Persians were
a warlike nation, less advanced in civilization than their
sovereign; hence his care of the finances of the empire
degraded him in their eyes, and comparing his character
with that of their former princes, while they called
Cyrus the father, and Cambyses the master, they denominated
Darius the broker of the empire. It was probably
under the knowledge of these feelings, that his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, thus addressed him:<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> “O
king, though possessed of such ample means, thou sittest
still, and gainest increase for the Persians neither of subjects
nor power. But it befits a young man who is the
master of vast resources, to manifest his worth in the performance
of some mighty act, that the Persians may fully
know they have a man for their king. Now, therefore,
it profiteth thee twofold to do thus, both that the Persians
may understand there is a man at their head, and
also that they may be harassed by war, and for lack of
leisure may not conspire against you. And now thou
mightest distinguish thyself during thy youth, for the
spirit groweth with the growing body; but it ageth also
with the aging body, and is blunted towards all action.”
Darius answered, “All these things which thou hast
suggested, I have resolved to perform, for I mean to
build a bridge from this mainland to the other, to march
against the Scythians, and within a little while all these
things shall be accomplished.” Atossa replied, “Do
not go first against the Scythians, for they will be at
your disposal at any time; but for my sake lead an army
against Greece. For I have heard reports of the Grecian
women, and wish much to have female slaves of
Lacedæmon, and Argos, and Corinth, and Athens.”</p>

<p>Some time elapsed before Darius was at leisure to pursue
his schemes of conquest; but after the Babylonian
rebellion was quelled, when the prosperity of Asia was
at its height, he determined to invade the Scythians under
pretence of revenging the desolating incursion of their
ancestors into Media, a century before. With this view
he sent orders throughout his dominions, to some nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that they should prepare infantry, others a fleet, others
construct a bridge across the Thracian Bosphorus, in
which a Grecian artist, Mandrocles of Samos, was employed.
The fleet, which was contributed by the Asiatic
Greeks, he sent on to the Ister, or Danube, with orders
to construct a bridge there also, which was done, two
days’ sail from the mouth of the river; the land forces<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> he
himself conducted through Thrace. Darius, though a
wise prince, was not exempt from that inordinate spirit of
boasting which has beset the eastern sovereigns in all ages.
At the source of the river Tearus, where are hot and cold
medicinal springs issuing from the same rock, he caused
a column to be set up, with this inscription:&mdash;“The
fountains of Tearus pour forth the best and fairest water
of all rivers, and thither, on his march against the Scythians,
came the best and fairest of all men, Darius, son
of Hystaspes, King of the Persians, and of all the continent.”
Another instance of this spirit occurs, when he
ordered a pile of stones to be raised at the river Artiscus,
as a monument of the magnitude of his army, each individual
being ordered to contribute one stone to the heap.
Passing onward,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> he crossed the Ister, and entered Scythia,
leaving the Ionians behind to protect his return, but
with permission to depart home, unless he should reappear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
within sixty days. The Scythians did not attempt
open resistance; they blocked up the wells and springs,
and destroyed the forage throughout the country; and
taking advantage of their own wandering habits, harassed
the Persians by leading them a fruitless chase in pursuit
of an enemy who seemed always within reach, and yet
could never be overtaken. After wandering over a vast
extent of desert, Darius began to weary of so unprofitable
an occupation, and indulging a hope, perhaps, that the
enemy would be complaisant enough to change their tactics
for his own convenience, sent the following message
to Idanthyrsus, the Scythian king: “O wonderful man,
why wilt thou still fly, having the choice of these two
things? If thou esteemest thyself capable to stand up
against me, abide, and do battle; but if thou acknowledgest
thyself to be the weaker, even then desist from
flight, and come to my presence, bringing earth and water,
gifts due to your master.” The proposal was conceived
in the spirit of our own chivalrous ancestors, and
from them might have met with a prompt acquiescence;
but Idanthyrsus was not to be piqued into an act of imprudence,
and in truth more wisdom is visible in his reply
than in the request which led to it. “O Persian,
this is my way: hitherto I have never fled for fear of any
man, neither do I now fly before thee, nor act otherwise
than I am wont in peace. And I will tell thee wherefore
I decline a battle. We have neither towns nor tilled
land, in defence of which we are compelled to fight; but
if it be of importance to thee to bring us to battle, lo,
there are the tombs of our ancestors; find them out, and
endeavour to destroy them, and thou shalt then know
whether we will fight for our sepulchres, or whether we
will not. But, until this, unless we ourselves see reason,
we will not fight. So much for fighting. For masters,
we own none, save Jupiter, my ancestor, and Vesta,
Queen of the Scythians. And instead of sending earth
and water, I will send you such a present as befits the
occasion; but as for calling thyself our master, I say, go
hang.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Now the Scythians were very angry at the bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
mention of servitude, and sent one division to commune
with the lonians who guarded the bridge, while the rest
of them, instead of still retreating before the Persians,
began to harass them by desultory attacks, in which the
Scythians had always the advantage over the Persian
cavalry; but when these fell back upon the infantry, they
were secure from further molestation. These attacks
were made continually by night and day. And now,
says Herodotus, I will mention a very strange thing, that
was of great service to the Persians against these assaults.
Scythia produces neither ass nor mule, neither are there
any such throughout the country, by reason of the cold.
The noise of the asses therefore disordered the Scythian
cavalry, and very often in a charge, when the horses
heard them bray, they would start and fly aside in terror,
pricking up their ears, for that they had never seen the
like, nor heard such a sound. At length, when the country
was exhausted, and it was known that Darius was in
want, the Scythian princes sent a herald, bearing a present
of a mouse, a bird, a frog, and five arrows. The
Persians asked what was the meaning of this offering;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
but he replied, that his orders were merely to deliver it
and depart immediately; and bade them, if they were
skilled in such things, discover what these gifts should
signify. Now Darius thought that the Scythians surrendered
to him themselves, their land, and waters, arguing
thus: that a mouse dwells in the earth, living on the same
food as man, and a frog in the water, and that a bird is
likest to a horse, and the arrows meant that they delivered
up to him their power. But Gobryas conjectured that it
meant this: “Unless, O Persians, you should become
birds and soar into the skies, or mice and sink beneath
the earth, or frogs and leap into the water, never shall
ye return home, being stricken by these arrows.” Now
that division of Scythians which had been sent to confer
with the Ionians, when they arrived at the bridge, said,
“Ye men of Ionia, we bring you liberty, if you will
hearken to us. For we hear that Darius bade you depart
home, after you had watched the bridge sixty days, if
he should not return within that time: now therefore
by so doing you will be free from blame, both towards
him and towards us.” And when the Ionians had
promised to do so, the Scythians returned in all haste.</p>

<p>Idanthyrsus, after sending the above alarming intimation,
changed his tactics, and offered battle to Darius.
It chanced that while the hostile armies were drawn up,
waiting for the signal to engage, a hare jumped up from
among the Scythians, who broke their ranks and joined
unanimously in the chase. Darius inquired from what
cause such a tumult arose, and hearing that the enemy
were engaged in hunting the hare, he said to his confidential
advisers, “These men hold us in great contempt;
and now methinks Gobryas has spoken rightly
concerning the Scythian presents. Since, therefore,
things are so, we need good advice, how may we retreat
in safety.” Gobryas made answer, “O king, I was
pretty well acquainted by report with the poverty of
these men, and now I am the more convinced of it,
seeing how they make sport of us. Therefore it seems
best to me, to light our fires as usual, so soon as the
night comes on, and then shackling the asses, and leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
them behind, with such as are least able to bear
fatigue, to depart before the Scythians can reach the
Danube to destroy the bridge, and before such a plan,
which might be our ruin, can be resolved upon by the
Ionians.” This advice gave Gobryas: and when it
was night, Darius left in the camp all those who were
wearied, and of whose death least account was made,
together with the asses, under pretence that he would
himself attack the enemy with the flower of the army,
and that the others should remain to protect the camp.
So the Scythians seeing the fires, and hearing the asses
as usual, suspected nothing: but the next morning, when
the deserted Persians came and made submission, they
set out with all speed, and arrived at the Danube before
Darius, who had wandered from the direct way. Then
they said, “Ye men of Ionia, ye act unjustly in staying
here after the days that were numbered have passed
away. Hitherto you have remained through fear; but
now, destroy the bridge, and depart with all haste, rejoicing
in your freedom, and acknowledging your obligation
to the gods and the Scythians. And him that
was heretofore your master we will so handle, that from
henceforth he shall wage war upon no man.” Therefore
the Ionians took counsel; and Miltiades the Athenian
(the same who afterwards commanded at Marathon)
that was their leader, and ruler over the Thracian
Chersonese, was minded to take the counsel of the
Scythians, and thus set free Ionia. But Histiæus, of
Miletus, said, on the contrary, that now each of them
that were in council was ruler over his own city through
the influence of Darius, which being destroyed, neither he
himself nor any of them would retain his sovereignty, for
every city would choose the government of the many rather
than of one. Those, therefore, that had adopted Miltiades’
opinion, now came over to that of Histiæus, and it was
resolved to break up the Scythian end of the bridge for the
distance of a bowshot, that they might appear to comply
with what had been requested, and thus be secured from
all attempts to destroy it. Histiæus therefore replied,
“O Scythians, you bring good advice, and urge it at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
seasonable moment, and as your proposition guides us
to our advantage, even so we are inclined to follow it
carefully. For, as you see, we are breaking up the
bridge, and we will manifest all zeal, desiring to be free.
But while we are thus employed, it is fit time for you
to go in search of the Persians, and to exact the vengeance
that is due both to us and to you.” So the Scythians,
a second time giving credit to the Ionians for
speaking the truth, returned in quest of the Persians,
but missed their track; so that the latter arrived at the
passage without interruption, but coming there by night,
and finding the bridge broken, they were thrown into
much alarm lest the Ionians should have deserted them.
There was in Darius’s train an Egyptian, whose voice was
louder than that of any known man. Darius bade him
stand on the bank, and call Histiæus the Milesian, who
heard him at the first shout, and reconstructed the bridge,
so that the army passed over in safety. And the Scythians,
judging of the Ionians from these transactions,
say, on the one hand, that they are the basest and most
unworthy of all freemen; and on the other, reckoning
them as slaves, that of all such they best love their masters,
and are least disposed to run away.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>If Darius’s real object was to extend his empire, or
take revenge upon the Scythians, his failure was complete
and humiliating; if undertaken on the ground suggested
by Atossa as a measure of policy, a safety&ndash;valve to guard
against the explosion of Persian turbulence, his purpose
probably was fully answered in the loss and suffering
which the army underwent. But whatever were his motives,
he escaped more easily and creditably than most
generals who have presumed to contest the possession of
their deserts with the numerous and active cavalry of
Tartary and Persia. Troops of the highest character,
irresistible where their proper arms and discipline can be
made available, have often sunk under the fatigue and
hardships of warfare against a new enemy, under a new
sky, and have been conquered by circumstances, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
without the use of the sword. By varying the climate and
natural features of the earth&mdash;by giving man a frame
which, notwithstanding the wonderful flexibility which
adapts it equally for the snows of Greenland and the
vertical splendour of the torrid zone, is ill calculated for
violent and sudden changes, Providence has set bounds
in some degree to the march of ambition, and often turned
the triumph of the conqueror into mourning. We shall
devote the rest of this chapter to relating a few of the
most striking disasters which have occurred from the
neglect of these considerations, and the rash invasion of
regions where the elements, the face of the country,
or the manners of its inhabitants have presented invincible
obstacles to the success of the attacking army.</p>

<p>The unfortunate expedition of Crassus against the Parthians
furnishes us with a second testimony to the valour
of the Scythian hordes. Expelled or emigrating from
Scythia Proper, that tribe long dwelt to the eastward of
the Caspian Sea, and successively obeyed the Mede, the
Persian, and the Macedonian dynasties, until at length
they shook off the yoke of the last, and planted a new
race upon the throne of Cyrus. The motives of avarice
and ambition which led Crassus to the fatal enterprise
in which he fell, are well known. From the first
he was marked out for destruction by superstitious terrors:
as he quitted Rome he was solemnly devoted by a tribune
to the infernal gods; ill&ndash;omened prodigies attended the
passage of the Euphrates, and even the exhortations of
the general were so equivocally worded, that, instead of
raising, they damped the courage of his soldiers. Instead
of penetrating through the friendly country of Armenia,
where the mountains would have protected him from the
enemy’s cavalry, and the king had promised not only a
large reinforcement, but to provide food for the consumption
of the Romans, Crassus was induced, by the
treachery of a pretended friend, to plunge into the deserts
of Mesopotamia, the region of all others best adapted to
the operations of his enemies. We shall not detain the
reader with the particulars of his advance, which for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
time was unopposed; but when he was fairly involved
in that inhospitable region, the enemy was not long in
making his appearance.</p>

<p>“The enemies seemed not to the Romans at the first
to be so great a number, neither so bravely armed as
they thought they had been. For concerning their
great number, Surenas<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> had of purpose hid them with
certain troops he sent before; and to hide their
bright armour he had cast cloaks and beasts’ skins over
them; but when both the armies approached near the
one to the other, and that the sign to give charge was
lift up in the air, first they filled the field with a
dreadful noise to hear; for the Parthians do not encourage
their men to fight with the sound of a horn, neither
with trumpets, but with great kettle&ndash;drums, hollow
within, and about them they hang little bells and copper
rings, and with them they all make a noise everywhere
together; and it is like a dead sound mingled as it were
with the braying or bellowing of a wild beast, and a
fearful noise as if it thundered, knowing that hearing is
one of the senses that soonest moveth the heart and
spirit of any man, and maketh him soonest beside
himself. The Romans being put in fear with this dead
sound, the Parthians straight threw the clothes and
coverings from them that hid their armour, and then
showed their bright helmets and cuirasses of Margian
tempered steel, that glared like fire, and their horses
barbed with steel and copper. And Surenas also,
general of the Parthians, who was a goodly personage
and valiant as any other in all his host, though for his
beauty somewhat effeminate, showed small likelihood of
such courage: for he painted his face and wore his hair
after the fashion of the Medes, when the other Parthians
drew their hair back from the forehead in the Scythian
manner to look more terrible. The Parthians at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
first thought to have set upon the Romans with their
pikes, to see if they could break their first ranks. But
when they drew near, and saw the depth of their battell
standing close together, firmly keeping their ranks, then
they gave back, making as though they fled, and dispersed
themselves; and yet, before they were aware,
environed them on every side; whereupon Crassus commanded
his shot and light&ndash;armed men to assail them;
the which they did: but they went not far, they were
so beaten in by arrows, and driven to retire to their force
of the armed men. And this was the first beginning
that both feared and troubled the Romans when they
saw the vehemency and great force of the enemy’s shot,
which brake their armours, and ran through everything
it hit, were it never so hard or soft. The Parthians,
thus still drawing back, shot altogether on every side at
adventure: for the battell of the Romans stood so neare
together, as, if they would, they could not miss the
killing of some. These bowmen drew a great strength,
and had much bent bowes, which sent the arrows from
them with a wonderful force.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The Romans by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
these bowes were in hard state, for if they kept their
ranks they were grievously wounded: again, if they left
them, and sought to run upon the Parthians to fight at
hand with them, they suffered none the less, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
no nearer to effecting anything. For the Parthians, in
retreating, yet cease not from their shot, which no nation
but the Scythians could better do than they. And it is
an excellent contrivance that they do fight in their
flight, and thereby shun the shame of flying. The
Romans still defended themselves, and held it out so
long as they had any hope that the Parthians would
leave fighting when they had spent their arrowes, or
would joyne battel with them. But after they understood
that there were a great number of camels laden
with quivers full of arrowes, where the first that had
bestowed their arrowes fetched about to take new
quivers; then Crassus, seeing no end to their shot,
began to faint, and sent to Publius his son, willing him
to charge upon the enemies before they were compassed
in on every side. For it was on Publius’ side that one of
the wings of the enemies battell was nearest unto them,
and where they rode up and down to compasse them
behind. Whereupon Crassus’ sonne, taking thirteene
hundred horsemen with him (of the which a thousand
were of the men of armes whom Julius Cæsar sent) and
five hundred shot, with eight ensignes of footmen having
targets, wheeling about, led them unto the charge. But
they seeing him coming, turned straight their horses and
fled, either because of the steadiness of his array, or else
of purpose to beguile this young Crassus, inticing him
thereby as far from his father as they could. Publius
Crassus seeing them flie, cryed out, ‘These men will
not abide with us;’ and so spurred on for life after them.
Now the horsemen of the Romans being trained out thus
to the chase, the footmen also were not inferior in hope,
joy, or courage. For they thought all had been won,
and that there was no more to do but to follow the chase:
till they were gone far from the army, and then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
found the deceit. For the horsemen that fled before
them suddenly turned again, and a number of others
besides came, and set upon them. Whereupon they
stayed, thinking that the enemies, perceiving they were
so few, would come and fight with them hand to hand.
Howbeit the Parthians drew up again them their men
at armes, and made their other horsemen wheele round
about them, keeping no order at all: who gallopping up
and down the plain, whirled up the sand&ndash;hills from the
bottom with their horses’ feet, which raised such a wonderful
dust, that the Romans could scarce see or speak to
one another. For they being shut up into a little
roome, and standing close one to another, were sore
wounded with the Parthian arrowes, and died of a cruell
lingering death, crying out for anguish and paine they
felt; and being still harassed by the shot thereof, they
died of their wounds, or striving by force to pluck out
the forked arrow&ndash;heads that had pierced farre into their
bodies through their veines and sinewes, thereby they
opened their wounds wider, and so injured themselves
the more. Many of them died thus, and such as died
not were not able to defend themselves. Then when
Publius Crassus prayed and besought them to charge the
men at armes with the barded horse, they shewed him
theirs hands fast nailed to the targets with arrowes, and
their feet likewise shot through and nailed to the ground;
so as they could neither flie, nor yet defend themselves.
Thereupon himself encouraging his horsemen, went and
gave charge, and did valiantly set upon the enemies,
but it was with too great disadvantages, both for offence
and also for defence. For himself and his men, with
weak and light staves, brake upon them that were armed
with cuirasses of steele, or stiff leather jackes. And the
Parthians, in contrary manner, with mighty strong pikes
gave charge upon these Gaules, which were either unarmed,
or else but lightly armed. Yet those were they
in whom Crassus most trusted, and with them did he
wonderfull feates of war. For they seized hold of the
Parthians’ pikes and took them about the middles and
threw them off their horse, being scarce able to stir for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the weight of their harnesse;<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and there were divers of
them also that lighting from their horse crept under their
enemies’ horse bellies, and thrust their swords into them,
which flinging and bounding in the aire for very paine,
trampled confusedly both upon their masters and their
enemies, and in the end fell dead among them. Moreover
extream heat and thirst did marvellously comber the Gauls,
who were used to abide neither of both: and the most
part of their horses were slain, charging with all their
power upon the Parthian pikes.</p>

<p>“At the length, they were driven to retire towards
their footmen, and Publius Crassus among them, who
was very ill by reason of the wounds he had received.
And seeing a sand&ndash;hill by chance not farre from them,
they went thither, and setting their horses in the middest
of it, compassed it in round with their targets, thinking
by this means to cover and defend themselves the better
from the barbarous people: howbeit, they found it contrary.
For the country being plain, they in the foremost
ranks did somewhat cover them behind, but they
that were behind standing higher than they that stood
foremost (by reason of the nature of the hill that was
highest in the middest) could by no means save themselves,
but were all hurt alike, as well the one as the
other, bewailing their inglorious and unavailing end. At
that present time there were two Grecians about Publius
Crassus, Hieronymus and Nicomachus, who dwelt in
those quarters, in the city of Carrhæ: they both counselled
Publius Crassus to steale away with them, and flie
to a city called Ischnæ, that was not farre from thence,
and took the Romans’ part. But Publius answered them,
that there was no death so cruel as could make him forsake
those that died for his sake.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> When he had so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
said, wishing them to save themselves, he embraced
them, and took his leave of them: and being very sore
hurt with the shot of an arrow through one of his hands,
commanded his shield&ndash;bearer to thrust him through with
a sword, and so turned his side to him for the purpose.
And most part of the gentlemen that were of that company,
slew themselves with their own hands. And for
those that were left alive, the Parthians got up the sandhill,
and fighting with them thrust them through with
their speares and pikes, and took but five hundred prisoners.
After that, they struck off Publius Crassus’ head,
and thereupon returned straight to set upon his father,
Crassus, who was then in this state.</p>

<p>“Crassus, the father, after he had willed his son to
charge the enemies, and that one brought him word he
had broken them, and pursued the chase; and perceiving
also that they that remained in their great battell,
did not presse upon him so neare as they did before, because
that a great number of them were gone after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
other; he then took courage, and keeping his men close,
retired with them the best he could by a hill’s side, looking
ever that his sonne would not be long before that he
returned from the chase. But Publius seeing himselfe
in danger, had sent divers messengers to his father, to
advertise him of his distresse, whom the Parthians intercepted,
and slew by the way; and the last messengers
he sent escaping very hardly, brought Crassus newes that
his sonne was but cast away, if he did not presently aid
him, and that with a great power. But in the meane
time the enemies were returned from his son’s overthrow
with a more dreadfull noise, and cry of victory
than ever before, and thereupon their deadly sounding
drummes filled the air with their wonderful noise. The
Romans then looked straight for a hot alarme; but the
Parthians that brought Publius Crassus’ head upon the
point of a lance, coming neere to the Romans, showed
them his head, and asked them, in derision, if they knew
what house he was of, and who were his parents: for it
is not likely, said they, that so noble and valiant a young
man should be the son of so cowardly a father as Crassus.
This sight killed the Roman hearts more than any other
danger throughout all the battell. For it did not set
their hearts on fire, as it should have done, with anger
and desire of revenge, but far otherwise, made them
quake for fear. Yet Crassus selfe shewed more glorious
in this misfortune than in all the warre beside. For
riding by every band, he cried out aloud, ‘The grief
and sorrowe of this losse, my fellowes, is no man’s but
mine, mine onely: but the mighty fortune and honour
of Rome remaineth still unvincible, so long as you are
yet living. Now, if you pity my losse of so noble and
valiant a son, my good soldiers, shew this in fury against
the enemy; make them dearly buy the joy they have
gotten; be revenged of their cruelty, and let not my
misfortune fear you. For why! aspiring minds sometime
must needs sustaine losse.’</p>

<p>“Crassus, using these persuasions to encourage his
soldiers for resolution, found that all his words wrought
none effect; but contrarily, after he had commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
them to give the shout of battell, he plainly saw that
their heartes were done, for that their shout rose but
faint, and not all alike. The Parthians on the other
side, their shout was greate, and lustily they rang it out.
Now when they came to joyne, the Parthians’ horsemen
wheeling all round the Romans, still galled them with
their archery, while their men at armes, giving charge
upon the front of the Romans’ battell, with their great
lances compelled them to draw into a narrow roome, a
few excepted that valiantly and in desperate manner ran
in among them, as men desiring, though they could do
the enemy but little harm, rather to die quickly by a
mortal wound. So were they soone dispatcht, with the
great lances that ranne them through, head, wood and
all, with such a force as oftentimes they ranne through
two at once. Thus when they had fought the whole day,
night drew on, and made them retire, saying that they
would give Crassus that night’s respite, to lament and
bewaile his sonne’s death: unlesse that otherwise he,
wisely looking about him, thought it better for his safety
to come and offer himself to King Arsaces’ mercy, than
to tarry to be brought to him by force. So the Parthians
camping hard by the Romans, were in very good
hope to overthrow them the next morning.”</p>

<p>In this miserable condition the only hope of safety
lay in the immediate prosecution of their retreat under
cover of the night; and this measure was accompanied
by the melancholy necessity of abandoning their wounded
men to the mercy of an implacable enemy. Crassus,
overcome with sorrow, laid himself down with his head
covered, and would see no man. His chief officers,
therefore, among whom was Cassius, afterwards celebrated
as one of the murderers of Cæsar, held a council
of war, and resolved upon immediate departure; a step
which held out the greater prospect of security, as the
Parthians never attacked by night, nor indeed took up
their quarters in near neighbourhood even to the weakest
enemy, for they used no sort of fortification or defence,
and if attacked in the dark their cavalry was difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
be equipped and their skill in archery useless.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Those
of the Romans who were capable of marching, retreated
without further loss to the town of Carrhæ; but the
Parthians slew all that were left, to the number of
4000 and upwards. Surena, lest the fugitives should
outstrip him by immediate flight, had recourse to a fraudulent
negotiation, which was insultingly broken off as soon
as his end was answered, and his troops collected before
the city. Escape, therefore, was now more difficult
than ever, and Crassus’ evil fortune, or want of penetration,
led him again to place confidence in a traitor, who
informed the enemy of the period fixed for departure,
and completed his villainy by entangling the army in a
morass. Cassius, mistrusting this man, returned to
Carrhæ. His guides advised him to remain there until
the moon were out of the sign of Scorpio; but he
answered, “I fear the sign of Sagittarius (<i>the archer</i>)
more,” and, departing immediately, escaped to Assyria
with 500 horsemen. Crassus, and the main body of
the army, after long struggling, had overcome the difficulties
in which they were involved, and were within a
few furlongs of the hills, when they were overtaken and
attacked by the Parthians.</p>

<p>“Then compassing Crassus in the middest of them,
covering him round with their targets, they spake nobly,
that never an arrow of the Parthians should touch the
body of their general, before they were slain, one after
another, and that they had fought it out to the last man
in his defence. Hereupon Surena, perceiving the Parthians
were not so courageous as they were wont to be,
and that if night came upon them, and that the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
did once recover the high mountains, they could never
possibly be met withall againe: he thought cunningly
to beguile Crassus once more by this device. He let
certain prisoners go of purpose, before whom he made
his men give out this speech, that the King of Parthia
would have no more mortal war with the Romans; but
far otherwise; he rather desired their friendship, by
shewing them some notable favour, as to use Crassus
very courteously. And to give colour to this bruit, he
called his men from fight, and going himself in person
towards Crassus with the chiefest of the nobility of his
boast, in quiet manner, his bow unbent, he held out his
right hand, and called Crassus to talk with him of peace,
and said unto him, ‘Though the Romans had felt the
force and power of their king, it was against his will;
howbeit that now he was very willing and desirous to
make them taste of his mercy, and was contented to
make peace with them, and to let them go where they
would.’ All the Romans besides Crassus, were glad
of Surena’s words. But Crassus, that had been deceived
before by their crafty fetches and devices; considering
also no cause apparent to make them change thus suddenly,
would not hearken to it, but first consulted with
his friends. Howbeit the soldiers, they cried out on
him to go, and fell at words with him, saying that he
would fain set them to fight with an enemy, with whom
he had not the heart to talk unarmed. Crassus tried
entreaty first, saying that if they would but persevere
for the remainder of the day, they might depart at night
through the mountaines and straight passages, where
their enemies would not follow them: and pointing
them the way with his finger, he prayed them not to
be faint&ndash;hearted, nor to despair of their safety, seeing
they were so neare it. But in the end, Crassus perceiving
that they fell to mutiny, and, beating of their
harnesse, did threaten him if he went not, fearing there
they would do him some villainy, went towards the
enemy, and coming backe a little, said only these words:
‘O Octavius, and you, Petronius, with all you Roman
gentlemen that have charge in this army, you all see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
now how I against my will am enforced to go to the
place I would not, and can witnesse with me how I am
driven with shame and force; yet I pray you, if your
fortunes be to escape this danger, that ye will report
wheresoever you come, that Crassus was slaine, not
delivered up by his own soldiers into the hands of the
barbarous people, but deceived by the fraud and subtilty
of his enemies.’</p>

<p>“Octavius would not tarry behind on the hill, but
went down with Crassus: but Crassus sent away his
sergeants that followed him. The first that came from
the Parthians unto Crassus were two mongrell Grecians,
who, dismounting from their horse, saluted him, and
prayed him to send some of his men before, and Surena
would shew them, that both himself and his train came
unarmed towards him. Crassus thereto made him
answer, that if he had made any account of his life,
he would not have put himself into their hands. Notwithstanding
he sent two brethren before, called the
Roscii, to know what number of men, and to what
end they met so many together. These two brethren
came no sooner to Surena but they were staid, and
himselfe in the mean time kept on his way a horsebacke,
with the noblest men of his army. Now when
Surena came neare to Crassus, ‘Why, how now,’
quoth he, ‘what meaneth this? a consul and lieutenant&ndash;generall
of Rome on foot, and we on horseback!’
Therewithal he straight commanded one of
his men to bring him a horse. Crassus answered Surena
again: ‘In that neither of them offended, each coming
to the meeting according to the custom of his country.’
Surena replied, ‘As for the treaty of peace, that was
already agreed upon between the king Hyrodes and
the Romans: howbeit that they were to go to the river
and there to set down the articles in writing; for you
Romans,’ said he, ‘do not greatly remember the capitulations
you have agreed upon.’ With those words, he
gave him his right hand. As Crassus was sending for
a horse; ‘You shall not need, saith Surena, for, look,
the king doth present you with this.’ And straight one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was brought him, with a golden bridle; upon which his
grooms mounted Crassus immediately, and following
him behind, lashed his horse to make him run the
swifter. Octavius, seeing that, first laid hand on the
bridle, then Petronius; and after them, all the rest of
the Romans also gathered about Crassus to stay the
horse, and to take him from them by force, that pressed
him on of either side. So they thrust one at another at
the first very angrily, and at the last fell to blowes.
Then Octavius drew out his sword, and slew one of the
barbarous noblemen’s horsekeepers; and another came
behind him, and slew Octavius, and on the other side
came Pomaxæthres, one of the Parthians, and slew
Crassus. As for them that were there, some of them
were slain in the field fighting for Crassus, and others
saved themselves by flying to the hill. The Parthians
followed them, and told them that Crassus had paid the
paine he deserved, and for the rest, that Surena bad
them come down with safety. Then some of them
yielded to their enemies; and others dispersed themselves
when night came, and of them very few escaped
with life. Others being followed and pursued by
the natives, were all put to the sword. So as it is
thought there were slain in this overthrow above
twenty thousand men, and ten thousand taken prisoners.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Not many years subsequent to this signal overthrow
the Roman eagle again swooped upon Assyria, and was
again compelled to wing back its disastrous flight to a
more congenial soil and climate. Encouraged by the
Syrian victories of his lieutenant Ventidius (the only
Roman down to the time of Trajan who ever celebrated
a triumph over the Parthians), and desirous to efface
the stain upon the empire’s honour by extorting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
restoration of the captured standards and prisoners,
Antony led into Media an army of 100,000 men. But
his enterprise, like those of his predecessors, proved
barren alike of profit or renown: for if he could boast
that the enemy, far from gaining any advantage over his
veteran troops, were uniformly baffled and repulsed during
a long and dangerous retreat, yet that retreat proved
as calamitous as the advance had been useless; and the
hardships of the desert were scarce less fatal to him
than the Parthian arrows to Crassus.</p>

<p>“When they came to go down any steep hills, the
Parthians would set upon them with their arrowes, because
they could go down but fair and softly. But
then again, the soldiers of the legion, that carried great
shields, returned back and enclosed the light&ndash;armed in
the middest amongst them, and did kneel one knee upon
the ground, and so set downe their shields before them;
and they of the second rank also covered them of
the first rank, and the third also covered the second;
and so from ranke to ranke all were covered. Insomuch
that this manner of covering and shading themselves
with shields was devised after the fashion of laying
tiles upon houses, and to sight was like the steps of
a theatre, and is a most strong defence and bulwarke
against all arrowes and shot that falleth on it. When
the Parthians saw this countenance of the Roman
soldiers of the legion which kneeled on the ground in
that sort upon one knee, supposing that they had beene
wearied with travel, they laid down their bowes, and
took their spears and launces, and came to fight with
them man for man. Then the Romans suddenly rose
upon their feete, and with the darts that they threw
from them they slew the foremost, and put the rest to
flight, and so did they the next day that followed. But
by means of these dangers and letts, Antonius’ army
could win no way in a day, by reason whereof they sufferred
great famine: for they could have but little corne,
and yet were they daily driven to fight for it; and besides
that, they had no instruments to grind it, to make
bread of it. For the most part of them had been left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
behind, because the beasts that carried them were either
dead or else employed to carry them that were sore and
wounded. For the famine was so extream great, that
the eighth part of a bushell of wheate was sold for fifty
drachmas,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and they sold barley bread by the weight of
silver. In the end they were compelled to live on herbes
and roots; but they found few of them that men do
commonly eat of, and were enforced to taste of them
that were never eaten before: among the which there
was one that killed them, and made them out of their
wits. For he that had once eaten of it, his memory went
from him, and he knew not what he did, but only busied
himself in moving and turning over every stone that he
found, as though it had been a matter of great weight.
All the campe over, men were busily stooping to the
ground, digging and carrying off stones from one place
to another; but at the last, they cast up a great deal of
bile, and suddenly died, because they lacked wine, which
was the only sovereigne remedy to cure that disease.”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Such were their suffering till they crossed the Araxes
and gained the rich and friendly country of Armenia.
The retreat from Phraata, or Phraaspa, the extreme
point of advance, a distance of three hundred miles, had
occupied twenty&ndash;seven days, and been signalized by
eighteen battles. On mustering the army it was found
that twenty thousand infantry and four thousand horse,
nearly a quarter of the whole force, had perished by
the joint effects of sickness and the sword.</p>

<p>After a long series of wars waged with various success
during a period of four hundred years, the plains of
Assyria again beheld the destruction of a Roman army
under circumstances of still greater interest. The emperor
Julian, redoubted for his brilliant victories in Gaul and
Germany, advanced with a veteran army of sixty&ndash;five
thousand soldiers, to avenge the insulted majesty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
empire, and retaliate upon the Persian monarch (for a
Persian dynasty again occupied the throne of Darius,
long held by a Grecian, and then by a Parthian conqueror)
for the invasion of Mesopotamia, in the reign
of his predecessor Constantius. He directed his march
towards Ctesiphon,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> where he crossed the Tigris, and
advanced into the central provinces, in hope, like Alexander
at Arbela, to rest the issue of the war on the event
of a single battle. Up to this point success attended his
arms; but now the evils which had destroyed his predecessors
began to work their fatal effect on him; where&ndash;ever
he turned the country was laid waste, the treachery
of his guides caused him to spend several days in fruitless
wandering, which diminished the already scanty stores
of the army, and at length, without a blow being struck,
he found himself compelled to give the signal for retreat.</p>

<p>“The very morning, however, upon which the army
began to retrace its steps, a cloud of dust appeared in the
distant horizon. Many thought that it was caused by
the troops of wild asses which abound in those regions;
others more justly augured from it an enemy’s approach.
Being thus uncertain and fearful lest by advancing they
should fall into some snare, the emperor put an early
stop to their march, and the night was spent in watchfulness
and continual alarm. At sunrise, the glitter of
distant armour announced the presence of the royal
forces, and the day was spent in a succession of desultory
and unsuccessful attacks. In the evening the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
arrived at a small town abounding in provisions, where
they spent two days. Resuming their march, upon the
first day they were exposed only to the same interruptions
as before, but upon the third day, when the
army had reached the district called Maranga, about
dawn there appeared a vast multitude of Persians, with
Merenes, general of the cavalry, two sons of the king,
and many of the chief nobility.</p>

<p>“All the troops were armed in iron, every limb being
protected by thick plates, the rigid joinings of which
were adapted to the joints of the body; and a mask,
fashioned to resemble the face, was so carefully fitted
upon their heads, that, their whole bodies being plated
with metal, the darts which struck them could pierce
nowhere, except at the eyes or nostrils, before which
there were narrow apertures for sight and breathing.
Those who were armed with lances remained immoveable,
as if fixed with brazen chains: while near them the
archers (from its very cradle the nation has grown
powerful by its great reliance on that art) stretched their
supple bows, with disparted arms, till the string touched
their right breasts, while their left hands were in contact
with the arrow head; and the shafts, thus skilfully
driven, flew shrilly whistling, charged with deadly wounds.
After them the affrighted mind could hardly bear the
fearful aspect and savage yawns of the glittering elephants;
by whose roar and smell, and unusual appearance,
the horses were yet more terrified. Those who guided
them wore hafted knives tied to their right hands, remembering
the injury received from these animals at Nisibis;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
that if the frantic animal became unmanageable by his
driver, to prevent his carrying destruction into the ranks
of his own army, as then happened, they might pierce
the spine, where the skull is connected with the neck.
For it was long ago discovered by Hasdrubal, the brother
of Hannibal, that such was the speediest way of killing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
these beasts. All this being observed, not without much
dread, the emperor proceeded with all confidence to
draw up the infantry for battle in a half&ndash;moon with
curving flanks;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and lest the advance of the archers
should scatter our close array, he broke the efficacy of
their arrow&ndash;flight by a rapid onset; and the word to
engage being as usual given, the dense infantry of Rome
dashed in the firm front of the enemy by a most spirited
charge. The conflict growing hot, the clang of shields,
and the melancholy crash of men and armour, leaving
now no room for inactivity, covered the ground with
gore and corpses; but the slaughter of the Persians was
the greatest, who being often slack and faint in close
conflict, fought at heavy disadvantage when foot was
opposed to foot; though they use to battle bravely at
a distance, and if they find themselves compelled to give
way, deter the enemy from pursuit by a shower of arrows
shot behind them. The Parthians then being routed by
their overpowering strength, our soldiery, long since
relaxed by a blazing sun, at the signal of recall went
back to their tents, inspirited to higher daring for the
future. In this battle the Persian loss appeared, as I
have said, to be the greater; our own was very light.”
Milton has a gorgeous description of the Parthian power
and method of making war, in which his immense learning
is profusely introduced to illustrate this subject</p>

<p class="p1">“After the battle,” Ammianus continues, “three
days being passed in repose, that each might cure his
own or his neighbour’s wounds, intolerable want of victuals
began to afflict us; and the burning both of corn
and green crops having reduced men and horses to the
extremity of distress, a large part of the provisions
brought by the chief officers of the army for their own
use was distributed to the indigent soldiery. And the
emperor, who, in place of delicacies prepared with regal
luxury, satisfied his hunger under a small tent, with a
scanty portion of meal and water, which even the
labouring common soldier would have disdained; careless
of his own safety, performed whatever services
were required in the tents of his poor comrades. Then
having withdrawn awhile to an anxious and uncertain
repose, devoted not to sleep, but to some literary work,
written in the camp, and under the tent&ndash;skins, in emulation
of Julius Caesar, in the dead of night, while
deeply meditating upon some philosopher, he beheld, as
he acknowledged to his friends, that vision of the genius
of the empire which he had seen in Gaul, when about to
reach the dignity of Augustus,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> pass sorrowfully from
the tent in mourning habit, his head and horn of abundance
covered with a veil. For a moment he was fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in amazement; yet, superior to all fear, he commended
futurity to the gods. As he rose from his lowly couch,
to supplicate the powers of heaven with the rites deprecatory
of misfortune, a blazing torch appeared to
flash across the sky, and vanished, leaving him filled
with horror lest it were the star of Mars which thus
openly menaced him.”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Before daybreak he consulted the Etruscan soothsayers,
who still retained the monopoly of this profitable
art, concerning the meaning of this portent. They
replied that on no account should anything be commenced,
in obedience to the rules of their science, which
forbade the giving battle, or undertaking military operations,
subsequent to the appearance of such a meteor:
but the emperor neglected their predictions, and gave
order to march. Taught by experience not rashly to
close with the firm ranks of the legions, the Persians
hovered all around, and while Julian, unarmed by reason
of the heat, advanced to reconnoitre in front, he was
alarmed by tidings of an attack upon the rear. Forgetful
or careless of his want of armour, he hurried to the
spot, which was scarcely reached when a fresh alarm
came that the van, which he had quitted, was similarly
menaced, and at the same moment the iron&ndash;clothed Parthian
cavalry, supported by elephants, dashed in upon
the flank. The light&ndash;armed troops, encouraged by their
sovereign’s presence, rushed forwards, and put to flight
these formidable assailants; and while Julian, forgetting
the prudence of a general in his ardour, cheered them
on, a dart grazed his uplifted arm, and penetrated deep
into his unprotected side. He tried to draw it out, but
the sharp edges cut the tendons of his fingers; and falling
in a swoon from his horse, he was borne back by
his attendants to the camp. The prince being withdrawn,
it is scarce credible with what ardour the soldiery, heated
by rage and anger, flew to their revenge, and though
the dust blinded them, and the heat relaxed their sinews,
yet, as if released from discipline by the fall of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
leader, they rushed prodigal of life upon the enemies’
steel. The Persians, on the other hand, shot still more
eagerly, till they were almost hidden by the constant
arrow flight; while the bulk and nodding plumes of the
elephants stationed in their front struck terror into horse
and man. Night put an end to a bloody and indecisive
contest, in which fifty of the chief Persian nobility fell,
including the two generals, Merenes and Nohodares.</p>

<p>This success, however, was dearly purchased by the
death of Julian, which occurred soon after he reached
the camp. He made a short address to those officers
who surrounded his bed, expressing his willingness to
die, and a hope that the empire would devolve on a
worthy successor, declining to interfere, or in any way
direct their choice; and breathed his last while arguing
upon the nature of the soul. Among the tumult and
intrigues consequent upon the election of a new emperor,
Jovian, a household officer of the highest rank, was
chosen, rather as a means of reconciling the disputes of
others of higher pretensions, than for his personal merits,
which rose not above mediocrity. The news of Julian’s
death was carried to Sapor the Persian king by deserters,
and he, inspirited by the death of his most formidable
enemy, pursued the retreating army with increased
vigour. On one occasion the heavy&ndash;armed horse and
elephants broke the Jovian and Herculean legions which
had been trained to war in the able school of Diocletian;
on another the Persian cavalry broke into the camp, and
penetrated almost to the emperor’s tent. At length,
after five days of constant harass and alarm, they reached
the town of Dura on the Tigris. Four days were here
consumed in repelling the unceasing attacks of the Persians,
until the army, impatient of this daily annoyance,
hopeless of bringing the enemy to battle, and stimulated
by a notion that the Roman frontier was at no great
distance, impatiently demanded permission to recross the
Tigris. The emperor and his officers in vain pointed
out to them the river swollen by the summer floods, and
entreated them not to trust its dangerous whirlpools: they
represented that most of the troops were unable to swim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and showed the enemy, who lined the opposite bank of
the overflowed river. But when these arguments proved
vain, and dissatisfaction seemed ready to end in mutiny,
a reluctant order was given that the Gauls and Germans,
trained to the passage of rapid rivers from their youth,
should first risk the attempt; in expectation that the
others’ obstinacy would be overcome by the spectacle of
their fate, or else that their success would embolden and
encourage the less able. Accordingly, as soon as the
fall of night concealed their purpose, they passed the
river, swimming or supported by skins, occupied the
opposite bank, and made slaughter of the Persians, who
had been lulled to sleep by the fancied security of their
position. Their comrades, informed of their success by
signal, were only restrained from emulating their courage
and success by the engineers undertaking to construct a
bridge upon inflated hides. But these attempts were
baffled by the strength of the stream, and at the end of
two days, all sorts of food being consumed, the soldiery,
reduced to want and desperation, were loud in complaint
of the ignoble death for which they were reserved.</p>

<p>This would have been the time for a vigorous and
decisive blow; but the Persian king was staggered in
his confidence by the Romans’ obstinate and successful
resistance. The destruction among his troops had been
severe; the loss of elephants unequalled in any former
war: while his foes were seasoned and encouraged by a
continuance of successful resistance, and, instead of being
intimidated by the death of their noble general, seemed
rather to consult revenge than safety, careless whether
they were extricated from their difficulty by a brilliant
victory or a memorable death. These considerations,
and the yet unbroken power of the empire, induced him
to send ambassadors to treat of peace. But the conditions
proposed were hard and humiliating, and four
days were spent amid the agonies of famine in fruitlessly
discussing what was best to be done, which if diligently
employed would have brought the army into the fruitful
district of Corduene, distant but a hundred and fifty
miles from the scene of their sufferings. Five provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
situated east of the Tigris were to be given up, together
with three important fortresses in Mesopotamia, Castra
Maurorum, Singara, and Nisibis, the latter uncaptured
since the Mithridatic wars, and regarded as the especial
key of the East. The strong expression of Ammianus
is, that it would have been better to have fought ten
battles, than to have surrendered one of these things.
But a crowd of flatterers surrounded the timid prince;
they urged the necessity of a speedy return, lest other
pretenders to the empire should start up, and his weak
and easy temper was readily persuaded to acquiesce.</p>

<p>The delay occasioned by these negotiations, in which,
in return for such important concessions, even the safe
passage of the Tigris was not provided for, proved fatal
to numbers, who, impatient of the sufferings which they
endured, plunged secretly into the stream, and were
swallowed up by its eddies, or, if they reached the shore,
were slain or sold into a distant captivity by the Saracens
and Persians. And when at last the trumpet gave the
signal of passage, it was wonderful to see how every one
hurried to escape the danger which they still feared upon
the eastern bank. Wicker vessels hastily constructed, to
which their beasts of burthen were attached, or the hides
of sheep and oxen, were the precarious means of transport
to which most were reduced: the emperor and his
suite crossed in a few small boats which had laboriously
accompanied the march, and continued to ply backwards
and forwards, as long as any remained upon the farther
shore. News came meanwhile that the Persians were
constructing a bridge, with intent of falling suddenly and
secretly upon the exhausted enemy; but either the intelligence
was false, or the betrayal of their intention
caused the Persians to desist from the meditated treachery,
and Jovian, released from this apprehension, arrived by
long and fatiguing marches at the town of Hatra, of
ancient fame in the wars of Trajan and Severus. From
hence, for seventy miles, an arid plain extended, offering
only salt, fetid water, and the bitter, nauseous herbs of
the desert: and such provision as opportunity afforded
was made for the further march by filling the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
vessels, and slaughtering camels and other beasts of burthen.
But a six days’ march, through a country where
not even grass was to be found, reduced them to extremity;
and it was with no small joy that they hailed a
convoy of provisions, doubly welcome as providing for
the relief of present distress, and assuring the fidelity of
Procopius and Sebastian, the powerful officers whom Julian
had sent to co&ndash;operate with him in Armenia. Passing
Thilsaphata the army at length reached Nisibis, and
found an end of its distresses under the walls of the city,
which the emperor was unwilling, perhaps ashamed, to
enter.</p>

<p>In all these cases the thirst of conquest worked its own
punishment by subjecting its votaries to the guidance of
will instead of reason, and like all other passions, when
indulged, misleading them both as to the character and
the probable consequence of their actions. The expedition
of Darius is said, indeed, to have been prompted by
policy; but we look in vain for prudence and sound
judgment in his unavailing pursuit of the Scythians, in
his protracted stay, in the treacherous abandonment of a
part of his army, or in his hurried retreat; while his resolution
(if Herodotus be credited) of destroying the bridge,
and thus, in case of reverses, cutting off all hope of escape,
could only have been suggested by a frantic presumption
in his own power and fortune. In the other
cases an eager desire and hope of terminating the war by
one decisive blow, and a well&ndash;grounded confidence that
in fair field no troops would stand the shock of the Roman
legions, stifled the voice of common sense, of wisdom and
of experience, which concurred in teaching that the
desired opportunity was attainable only by the enemy’s
misconduct, and that the failure of success necessarily
involved severe misfortune. We may draw from hence
a lesson touching the pernicious influence of power and
prosperity upon the mind. The warning of Amasis to
Polycrates<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> contains valuable instruction, though we reject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the superstitious and unworthy notion of the Deity
upon which it is founded, and the equally superstitious
remedy proposed. It is true that a life of unbroken
prosperity is frequently terminated by some memorable
reverse, but the effect of such prosperity upon ourselves
is the greatest of evils, and the parent of all the others
which may befall us: and this chapter may be considered
as a supplement to the one which has been devoted to
the effects of absolute power upon the morals and intellect;
for the judicial blindness produced by an inferior
degree of grandeur and good fortune resembles that species
of insanity which we have noticed, and differs from
it rather in degree than in nature. History abounds in
examples of such infatuation; the most striking and perhaps
the most important of them, it has been reserved
for our own age to witness.</p>

<p>If ever there was an instance of a powerful mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
delivered over for its ruin to a strong delusion, it is to
be found in Napoleon’s campaign in Russia. An unparalleled
series of victories appears to have confirmed
the turn of his mind to fatalism, and to have inspired a
belief that no difficulties were insuperable by his genius
and fortune. It is in such a belief, and in his natural
resoluteness of purpose, aggravated into inflexibility by
the habit of dictating to all who came within his widely
extended sphere, that we must look for the explanation
of conduct into which no man would have been
betrayed while in the full and sane possession of his
judgment, however just and unbounded his confidence in
himself and his troops. That he was fully aware
of the difficulties which he was about to meet (it is
impossible that they should have escaped his penetration)
is evident from his own declarations. “For masses like
those we are about to move, if precautions be not taken,
the grain of no country can suffice. The result of my
movements will be to assemble four hundred thousand
men on a single point. There will be nothing to expect
from the country, and it will be necessary to have everything
within ourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Immense preparations were
accordingly made, but made in vain, for a very small
portion of them ever reached the borders of Russia, and
those too late to supply the needs of the army. It is
here that the obstinacy and infatuation of which we
have spoken first appear. Too impatient to wait for the
supplies which he had declared indispensable, and unable
to resist the temptation of endeavouring to gain his
object by one decisive stroke, Napoleon plunged
headlong into a savage country, without a commissariat,
and with a most insufficient hospital department, and
suffered grievous loss before an enemy was even seen.
Without anything approaching to a general action, the
effective force under his immediate command was reduced
in six weeks, between the passage of the Niemen and
his departure from Witepsk, from two hundred and
ninety&ndash;seven thousand to one hundred and eighty&ndash;five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
thousand; and was besides in so shattered and unsoldier&ndash;like
a condition, that a fortnight later, at Smolensk, Napoleon
himself declared halt or retreat to be impracticable.
“This army cannot stop: with its composition,
and in its disorganized state, movement alone supports
it. We may advance at its head, but not stop or retreat.
It is an army of attack, not of defence; of operation, not
of position.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The desperate enterprise was therefore
pursued, and the nominal victory of Borodino, which
cost in killed and wounded thirty thousand men, gave
Moscow into his hands&mdash;the specious prize which he
hazarded so much to gain. But the advantages hoped
from its possession vanished when in his grasp, and this
seeming success proved but a snare to disguise his failure,
and ensure destruction by delaying retreat.</p>

<p>We probably shall never be satisfied as to the real
origin of the conflagration of Moscow. If the voluntary
act of the Russian people, it deserves to be classed, with
the abandonment of Athens, among the noblest acts of
patriotism recorded; but with this difference, that the
Athenians trusted their property to the victor’s mercy,
the Russians inflicted on themselves the utmost losses of
war, rather than allow an invader to profit by the shelter
of their homes. That a rugged but deep love of their
country did animate even those among them who had
least to love, is certain. Palaces and hamlets were alike
committed to the flames; the serf and the prince were
equally indignant at their national injuries. “It is an
admitted fact, that when the French, in order to induce
their refractory prisoners to labour in their service,
branded some of them in the hand with the letter N. as
a sign that they were the serfs of Napoleon, one peasant
laid his hand upon a block of wood, and struck it off
with the axe which he held in the other, in order to free
himself from the supposed thraldom.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Napoleon depended on the possession of Moscow as a
sure means of dictating peace to Russia on his own terms.
As formerly at Vienna and Berlin, he expected to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
laws in the Kremlin to a conquered nation; and his disappointment
in finding this vantage&ndash;ground crumble
under his feet was extreme. It was lost, however, irrecoverably
lost, for the Russians had no longer anything
to hope or fear for their capital, and Moscow, ruined and
deserted, was no place for the invader to pass a five&ndash;months’
winter in. Policy therefore prompted an immediate
retreat, sufficient time being allowed to refresh and
re&ndash;organize the army; but Napoleon still clung with obstinacy
to his original plan of dictating a peace to Alexander
from his capital, and sacrificed a fortnight of precious
time to this deceitful hope. It was frustrated; the
Russian monarch refused to listen to any overtures of
peace, and the French, who on the 12th of September
had hailed Moscow as the goal of their labours, quitted
it on the 19th of October, to retrace their steps over a
ravaged country through a numerous and exasperated
enemy.</p>

<p>We must touch very lightly upon the horrors of the
retreat, confining ourselves to a brief statement of the
leading facts, and of the results of the whole. Famine,
cold, and the sword combined to punish an unjust aggression.
When the French left Moscow they numbered
one hundred and twenty thousand men under arms,
with an immense train of baggage and camp followers:
in twenty&ndash;six days, from October 19th to November
13th, when the Emperor quitted Smolensk, their organized
force was reduced to thirty&ndash;six thousand men, and
they had lost three hundred cannon. Napoleon’s partisans
have tried to shelter him from blame, by alleging
the premature rigour of winter as the cause of this wholesale
destruction. No doubt cold was the main agent in
it, but the nature of a Russian winter was well known,
and should have been considered in the scheme of the
campaign; and so far was it from being premature, that
the frost did not begin till November 7th, only three
days before the French van and the Emperor arrived at
Smolensk. Other causes aided to produce this result.
Napoleon intended to return to the above&ndash;named town
by the unwasted route of Kalouga and Medyn, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Russian army barred his way, and, after an obstinate
contest,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> turned him back on the ravaged country
through which he had already passed. Here neither
food, shelter, nor clothing could be procured, and thousands
fell victims rather to the want of all appliances to
bear it, than to the intolerable severity of the winter
itself. Numbers fell in battle, or were intercepted and
slain, or made prisoners by the ever active hostility of
the Cossacks who hovered round their march: still the
loss sustained in warfare was small in comparison to that
which resulted from the combined operation of hunger
and cold. The appearance of this new enemy, and its
effects, moral and physical, are powerfully, though rather
theatrically, described by the Comte de Segur, himself
a sharer in the miseries which he describes.</p>

<p>“On the 6th of November the sky declared itself.
Its azure disappeared. The army marched enveloped in
cold vapours, which soon thickened into a vast cloud,
and descended in large flakes of snow upon us. It
seemed as if the sky were coming down, and uniting with
this hostile land and people to complete our ruin. All
things are indistinguishable; while the soldier struggles
to force his way through the drifting whirlwind, the
driven snow fills up all hollows, and its surface conceals
unknown depths which yawn under our feet. The men
are swallowed by them, and the weakest, resigning themselves
to fate, there find a grave. Those who follow
turn aside, but the storm dashes in their faces the snow
from heaven and the drift from the earth, and seems to
oppose itself rancorously to their march. The Russian
winter under this new form attacks them from all sides;
it pierces their thin dress and torn shoes. Their wet
clothes freeze on them, a sharp and strong wind impedes
their breath, which at the instant of expiration forms
round the mouth icicles depending from the beard. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
wretches, shivering, still drag themselves on, till the
snow which clogs their feet, or some chance obstacle,
causes them to stumble and fall. There they groan in
vain: the snow soon covers them; slight elevations alone
distinguish them: behold their graves! Everywhere
the road is strewn with these undulations like a burial&ndash;ground:
the most fearless, the most unfeeling are
moved, and turn aside their eyes as they pass in haste.
But before, around, every thing is snow&mdash;the sight is
lost in this immense and sad uniformity; the imagination
is astounded: it is like a huge winding&ndash;sheet, with
which nature envelops the army. The only objects
which appear from out it are sombre pines, trees of the
tombs, with their funereal verdure; and the gigantic
fixedness of their black trunks and their deep gloom
complete this desolate aspect of a general mourning,
and of an army dying amid the decease of nature....
Then comes the night, a night of sixteen hours! But
on that snow which covers all things, one knows not
where to stop, where to rest, where to find roots for food,
or dry wood for firing. However, fatigue, darkness,
and repeated orders stop those whom their own physical
and moral force, and the efforts of their officers, have retained
together. They seek to establish themselves;
but the ever&ndash;active storm scatters the first preparations
for a bivouac. The pines, laden with hoar&ndash;frost, resist
the flames; and the snow upon them, mixed with that
which falls continually from the sky, and that lying on the
earth, which melts with the efforts of the soldier and the
first effect of the fires, extinguishes those fires and the
strength and courage of the men.</p>

<p>“When the flame at length is raised, officers and
soldiers prepare around it their sad meal, composed of
lean and bloody fragments of flesh, torn from wornout
horses, and, for a very few, some spoonfuls of rye flour
diluted with snow&ndash;water. The next day soldiers, laid
stone&ndash;dead in circles, mark the bivouacs, and the ground
about them is strewed with the bodies of many thousand
horses.</p>

<p>“From this day, men began to reckon less upon each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
other. In this army, lively, susceptible of all impressions,
and inclined to speculate from its advanced civilization,
disorder soon gained footing, discouragement and
insubordination spread rapidly, the imagination wandering
without bounds in evil as well as good. Henceforward
at every bivouac, at every difficult passage,
some portion of the yet organized troops detached itself,
and fell into disorder. Yet there were some who resisted
this mighty contagion: they were the officers, subalterns,
and seasoned soldiers. These were extraordinary men;
they encouraged themselves by repeating the name of
Smolensk, which they felt they were approaching, and
where everything had been promised to them.</p>

<p>“Thus since this deluge of snow, and the redoubled
cold which it announced, all, officers and soldiers alike,
preserved or lost their strength of mind, according to
their age, their character, and temperament. He of
our chiefs, whom till then we had seen the strictest in
maintaining discipline, now found himself no longer
in his element. Thrown out of all his fixed ideas of
regularity and method, he was reduced to despair by so
universal a disorder, and judging sooner than others
that all was lost, he felt himself ready to abandon all.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The army quitted Smolensk in four divisions: that
under the command of the Emperor, which led the way,
marched on the 14th November. Ney, who throughout
this long retreat brought up the rear, who distinguished
himself amid its horrors by indomitable courage and constancy,
and was hailed by the general voice as the hero
of the army, remained behind until the 17th. On the
20th all were once more united at Oreza, after seven
days of almost continued fighting, in which nothing but
the sluggishness of the Russian general saved the French
from destruction, and Napoleon from captivity or death.
Opposed with fifteen thousand men, half starved and
half armed, to a force treble that number, and in good
condition, the Russians must have overthrown him by
mere physical force, had they ventured upon a vigorous
attack; but even in his distresses the presence of Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
inspired awe. At no time do the brilliant qualities
of the French troops appear more conspicuous than in
this disastrous retreat: headed on all sides, inclosed by
an overwhelming force, every general outman&oelig;uvred or
cut his way through the enemy,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> fortunate if it cost him
but half of his corps to preserve the remainder from the
disgrace of surrender. Between Smolensk and Oreza
the army was still further reduced to twelve thousand
men, who still preserved their arms and their discipline,
encumbered with thirty thousand stragglers, who grievously
increased its wants and its embarrassments, without
adding a single bayonet to its strength.</p>

<p>Hitherto its retreat had been unopposed, the Russian
army having been unwilling or unable to head the French
and compel them to force a passage by the sword; and
being in possession of Oreza, it passed the river Dnieper
at that town without opposition. But Admiral Tchitchagoff,
the general in command of the Moldavian army,
which was opposed to the Austrians on the south&ndash;eastern
end of the French base of operation, finding them slack
and unenterprising in the cause of an ally, or master
rather, to whom in truth they owed little good will, left
merely a division in the duchy of Warsaw to observe
their movements, and himself marched upon Minsk
and Borizoff, to cut off Napoleon’s retreat. At the latter
town there was a bridge over the Beresina, the place itself
being on the eastern bank, and on the possession of
the town and command of the bridge depended the means
of crossing that river. Tchitchagoff however, owing to
some mistake of the French general opposed to him, had
taken that town, and though afterwards expelled, had
made the bridge impassable in his retreat. It was necessary,
therefore, to seek a passage elsewhere, and a place
above Borizoff, called Studzianka, was selected, where
the river was only fifty&ndash;five fathoms across. The chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
seemed desperate, for the opposite heights were occupied
by six thousand Russians, and bridges were to be
built, and the army was to defile across them under their
fire; but desperate as it was, this seemed their only hope,
and Napoleon quitting the highway plunged into the
thick pine&ndash;woods which border the Beresina, to conceal
his march. The joy of the army may well be imagined,
when, in traversing these forests, they met the division
of Victor, of fifty thousand men, in good order, which
had been employed in checking Wittgenstein upon the
western flank. “They were ignorant of our disasters,
which had been carefully hidden even from their chiefs.
So that when, instead of a grand victorious column returning
from Moscow, they saw behind Napoleon nothing
but a train of squalid spectres, covered with rags,
with women’s pelisses, pieces of carpet, or squalid cloaks
scorched red and burnt into holes by the fires, their feet
wrapped up in tatters of all sorts, they stopped in terror.
They saw with affright these poor fleshless soldiers file
past, with faces like the grave, bristled with ghastly
beards, without arms, without shame, marching in disorder
with downcast heads, eyes fixed on the earth, and
silent like a troop of captives.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> So contagious was this
spectacle, that on the first day two corps of Victor’s army
fell into the same state of disorganization.</p>

<p>Among other attempts to deceive Tchitchagoff and
make him believe that a passage would be attempted
elsewhere, some Jews had been interrogated concerning
the passes of the river; and to secure the breach of their
faith, they had been sworn to meet the army on the
Beresina, below Borizoff, with intelligence of the enemy.
The stratagem succeeded; they carried a false report to
the Admiral, and he and Napoleon turned their backs
on each other, and while the latter marched up the river
to Studzianka, the former marched down it to a ford at
Oukoholda. All night the French laboured to construct
a bridge, expecting momentarily the first salvo of the
Russian artillery. Napoleon passed a restless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
agitated night in a château near the river, continually
repairing to the spot on which his last hope of escape
rested. At morning, when all were prepared for a
desperate and almost hopeless struggle, they were equally
astonished and delighted to see the Russian watch&ndash;fires
abandoned and the opposing force in full retreat. Napoleon
would scarce believe the tidings, and when at
last convinced by the evidence of his own eyes, he
cried in transport, “Then I have outwitted the Admiral.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>That day, November 26th, two bridges were completed,
and the opposite bank was occupied by Ney.
Two days and two nights elapsed before the Russians
came up, but this valuable respite was lost, owing to the
breaking of the bridge for artillery, and the insubordination
of the stragglers, which rendered it impossible to
force them across. On the night of the 26th they were
dispersed among the neighbouring villages; on the 27th
men, horses, and carriages rushed in an overwhelming
mass, and choked the narrow entrance of the bridges:
all efforts to restore order were fruitless, and it was
necessary to employ force to clear a passage for the
Emperor. A corps of grenadiers of the Guard declined
from mere pity to open for themselves a way through
these wretches. On the approach of night another
simultaneous movement drove them all to seek shelter
in the village of Studzianka, which was torn down to
furnish materials for fires, from which they could not be
moved; and thus another night was lost.</p>

<p>On the 28th, while Tchitchagoff on the right bank in
vain endeavoured to drive Ney back upon the bridges,
Wittgenstein, with vastly superior forces, attacked Victor,
who still remained on the left bank with 6000 men to
cover the retreat of his unhappy comrades. The first
thunder of the artillery drove this confused mass pell&ndash;mell
from their bivouacs to the bridge, and the first Russian
bullet which fell among them seemed the signal of distraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and despair. The horrors of the scene which
ensued are almost too great for description. The more
desperate forced a way sword in hand through the
crowd; others, prompted by a horrible avarice, crushed
their fellow&ndash;creatures under their carriage&ndash;wheels, rather
than abandon the booty hitherto preserved with such
labour; while those who felt themselves unequal to the
struggle sat apart in silence, their eyes fixed on the snow
which was soon to be their tomb. Once driven from
the direct passage, men struggled in vain to climb the
sides of the bridge; they were mercilessly forced back
into the river: even women, their infants in their arms,
shared this fate.</p>

<p>In the midst of this disorder the bridge for artillery
broke, and all upon it, hurried on by the press, were
ingulfed in the stream. The shriek of the perishing
multitude rose high above the storm and the battle: a
witness of the scene declared that for weeks that horrible
sound never quitted his ears. Artillery and waggons
then poured to the other bridge, and on the steep and
icy bank whole ranks were prostrated under their wheels,
or crushed between their unmanageable weights. The
noise of the storm, the roaring of cannon, the combined
whistling of the wind and bullets, the bursting of shells,
the cries, the groans, the fearful imprecations of the
crowd, united in as horrible a concert as ever was presented
to human ears. At nine at night Victor, who
till then had kept Wittgenstein in check, commenced
his retreat, and opened a dreadful passage through the
wretches whom he had hitherto defended. A rear&ndash;guard
was still left, and the bridges were allowed to stand that
night, but in vain; men seemed to lose their reason with
their discipline, and to be stupified by the horrors of
their situation. The baggage and plunder, to which they
clung so obstinately, was burnt: still it was impossible to
drive them on. The next morning the French set fire
to the bridge, and numbers lost their lives in a final
effort of despair, endeavouring to swim the icy river or
to cross upon the burning rafters. After the thaw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
according to the Russian reports, 36,000 bodies were
found in the Beresina.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The French, having forced back and defeated Tchitchagoff,
were now delivered from all immediate danger; and
Napoleon, who had hitherto refused to quit the army,
hastened to Paris, where internal affairs called for his presence,
leaving Murat his successor in command. From
this time forward the Russians, except Platoff and his
Cossacks, desisted from the pursuit; but this alleviation
of their misfortunes was fully compensated by other evils.
A change had already taken place in the weather; the
storms which had hitherto been experienced were succeeded
by a still more dreadful calm. Icy needles were
seen floating in the air; the very birds fell stiff and
frozen, everything possessing life or motion seemed congealed
by the intensity of cold.</p>

<p>“In this empire of death we passed on like unhappy
spirits. The dull, uniform sound of our march, the
crackling of the snow, the low groans of dying men,
alone broke this mighty melancholy silence. There
was no more anger, no more imprecations, nothing to
indicate a trace of heat; strength scarce remained even
for prayer, and the majority fell even without complaint,
whether through weakness or resignation, or that men
only complain when they hope to move, and believe that
they are pitied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“In fact, when for an instant they stopped through
exhaustion, the winter laid her icy hand on them, and
seized them as her prey. It was in vain then that, feeling
themselves numbed, they arose, and speechless,
stupified, advanced some paces like automatons: the
blood freezing in their veins checked the beating of
their hearts, and thence rushed to the head; then stricken
by death, they staggered like drunken men. Real tears
of blood dropped from their eyes, inflamed by the unvaried
glare of snow, by want of sleep, and by the smoke
of the bivouacs; deep sighs burst from their breasts;
they looked to heaven, to us, and to the earth with a
dismayed, fixed, and wild eye; it was their last adieu,
perhaps a reproach to that savage nature which so
tormented them. Soon they dropped, on their knees
first, then on their hands; their heads wandered still
some moments to right and left; a few sounds of agony
escaped from the gasping mouth, which in its turn fell
on the snow, and reddened it with livid blood, and their
sufferings were over.</p>

<p>“Such were the last days of the grand army; its last
nights were still more dreadful. When surprised by the
dark at a distance from all dwellings, they stopped on
the border of some wood; there they lighted fires,
before which they spent the night, upright and immoveable
as spectres. Unable to get enough of heat,
they crowded so close to them, that their clothes and
even frozen portions of their bodies were burnt. Then
a horrible pain compelled them to enlarge their circle,
and on the morrow they endeavoured in vain to rise.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>We trace no further the details of suffering too great
for human endurance. Sixty thousand men are computed
to have crossed the Beresina. Loison, with 15,000,
advanced from Wilna to meet and protect them; he lost
12,000 by three days of frost. Other reinforcements
joined the retreat; yet of this total, amounting fully to
80,000 men, there recrossed the Niemen but 20,000
stragglers, nine cannon, and 1000 infantry and cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
under arms, and the merit of preserving this remnant
belongs to Ney alone. Murat, to whom Napoleon at
his departure intrusted the command&ndash;in&ndash;chief, and other
marshals, had ceased to issue orders, or commanding, had
ceased to be obeyed: Ney alone retained some influence
and authority. Ever last in the retreat, with a rearguard
sometimes of twenty men, he opposed a bold front
to his pursuers, and pre&ndash;eminently merited the title of
“bravest of the brave,” when the tried valour of others
was changed into confusion and despair.</p>

A striking instance of this occurs in Justin. Speaking
of Harmodius and Aristogiton (see chap. v.), he says, “One
of the murderers, being put to the torture to extract the
names of his accomplices, enumerated all the nearest friends
of Hippias. These were all put to death, and being asked
whether any others were privy to his designs, he answered,
that now none remained whom he wished to perish, except
the tyrant himself. The city, admonished by his virtue,
expelled Hippias.”&mdash;Lib. ii. 9. The <i>virtue</i> of this act consisted
in sacrificing innocent lives to his revenge, by means
of a lying accusation: and the stern endurance of this man
is dignified with the praise of fortitude and patriotism, without
the slightest reference to its atrocious injustice. The
story itself rests upon Justin’s authority, and may reasonably
be rejected as an improbable fiction.</p>

We speak with some degree of doubt, both from the
fluctuating notions of the Greeks upon this head, and from
imperfect acquaintance with their opinions. The unhesitating
belief of the Celtic nations in a happy immortality was
known even in the time of Lucan, and is celebrated by him
in a fine and well&ndash;known passage. The immortality of Homer’s
heroes was mournful and discontented. “Talk not to
me of death,” says Achilles (Od. xi. 487), “I would rather
be the hired servant of some needy man, whose means of life
are scanty, than rule over the whole of the deceased.” Other
passages to the same effect are collected at the beginning of
the third book of the Republic, by Plato, who objects seriously
to their effect as making death an object of terror. Yet,
in another passage, Homer speaks of the “Elysian plain, and
the ends of the earth, where man’s life is easiest, where there
is no snow, nor rain, nor winter, but thither ocean ever wafts
the clear&ndash;toned gales of the west to refresh men.” (Od. iv.
565.) Hesiod, on the other hand (Works and Days, v. 166),
and, some centuries after, Pindar (Ol. ii.), speak of a future
life as perfectly happy, describing it in terms closely similar
to those of the last quotation from Homer. All these writers
appear to place their happiness in perfect rest: the blessed
are no longer compelled to till the earth, or navigate the
ocean; they lead a <i>careless</i> life; there is no reference to sensual
pleasures, except that the earth produces fruits spontaneously
thrice a year, nor even to their continuing to take
delight in arms or in the chace. In later authors they are
described as retaining the habits and pleasures of life: see
the note on the scholium of Callistratus, chap. v.; Ov. Met.
iv. 444; and more especially the passage in Virgil, vi. 651,
which, but for wanting the personal superintendence of Odin,
bears much resemblance to a refined Valhalla.</p>

<p class="pfp8 p1">The chief beheld their chariots from afar,<br />
Their shining arms, and coursers trained to war;<br />
Their lances fixed in earth, their steeds around,<br />
Free from their harness, graze the flowery ground.<br />
The love of horses, which they had alive,<br />
And care of chariots, after death survive.<br />
Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain,<br />
Some did the song and some the choir maintain.</p>
<p class="pfr4"><i>Dryden.</i></p>

<p class="pfc6 p1">
Mitford, on the other hand, says, that “the drunken paradise
of the Scandinavian Odin was really a notion, as we learn
from Plato, of the highest antiquity among the Greeks.”
(Chap. ii. sect. 1.) He has not, however, given references,
and we much regret that we have not been able to find the
passage.</p>

Perhaps this is too positively asserted. No doubt exists
as to the political operation, but it has been questioned

The arrival of Theseus at Athens roused Medea’s jealousy,
and she proposed to poison him. She did not arrive
at Athens until some time after she had reached Greece with
Jason and the Argonauts; while the journey of Theseus
from Tr&oelig;zen to Athens appears to have been his first exploit.
Either, therefore, Theseus was not an Argonaut, or
this charge against Medea is ungrounded.</p>

As if to call upon her foes the constant heart to see<br />

Pausanias evidently founded his account of Aristomenes
upon the traditions and legendary ballads of the Messenians;
which, probably, were about as historical as Chevy Chase,
or the Spanish ballads of the Cid, and other celebrated warriors.
The reader will be on his guard, therefore, against
taking all that is here told for veracious history: but we
have not attempted to discriminate accurately between truth
and fiction, which would entirely destroy the spirit and
romance of the narrative, very probably without coming
nearer to the reality.</p>

Pausanias merely says that the Greeks in general believed
Pyrrhus to be his father. We have no doubt, from
the context, that the hero is the person meant, though the
passage has been otherwise interpreted. The practice of
deifying eminent men prevailed in Greece at an early period,
though apparently not in the age of Hesiod and Homer.
Homer is fond indeed of dwelling on the superiority of the
past; a superiority referred to the celestial descent of the
heroes who then flourished; but he gives us no reason to
think that divine honours were paid them. In later times,
a patron hero was as necessary to a Grecian, as a patron
saint formerly to a European city: and there are few names
of eminence in the heroic age, in honour of which temples
have not been built, and sacred rites instituted. The twelve
Athenian tribes had each its protecting hero: Æacus and his
descendants were believed to preside over Ægina and Salamis.
It is needless to multiply examples.</p>

Probably this story is founded on the theft of the Palladium
by night from Troy, by Ulysses and Diomed. A
similar spirit of chivalrous daring, mingled with superstition,
suggested a similar enterprise to Fernando Perez del Pulgar,
surnamed ‘of the Exploits,’ when serving at the siege of
Granada under Ferdinand of Castile. “Who will stand by
me,” said he, “in an enterprise of desperate peril?” The
Christian cavaliers well knew the hair&ndash;brained valour of del
Pulgar, yet not one hesitated to step forward. He chose fifteen
companions, all men of powerful arm and dauntless
heart. In the dead of the night he led them forth from the
camp, and approached the city cautiously, until he arrived
at a postern gate, which opened upon the Darro, and was
guarded by foot soldiers. The guards, little thinking of
such an unwonted and partial attack, were for the most part
fast asleep. The gate was forced, and a confused and chance
medley skirmish ensued. Fernando stopped not to take part
in the affray. Putting spurs to his horse, he galloped
furiously through the streets, striking fire out of the stones at
every bound. Arrived at the principal mosque, he sprang
from his horse, and kneeling at the portal, took possession of
the edifice as a Christian chapel, dedicating it to the blessed
Virgin. In testimony of the ceremony, he took a tablet,
which he had brought with him, on which was inscribed, in
large letters, Ave Maria, and nailed it to the door of the
mosque with his dagger. This done, he remounted his steed,
and galloped back to the gate. The alarm had been given,
the city was in an uproar; soldiers were gathering from
every direction. They were astonished at seeing a Christian
warrior speeding from the interior of the city. Fernando,
overturning some and cutting down others, rejoined his companions,
who still maintained possession of the gate by dint
of hard fighting, and they all made good their retreat to the
camp. The Moors were at a loss to conjecture the meaning
of this wild and apparently fruitless assault, but great was
their exasperation when, on the following day, they discovered
the trophy of hardihood and prowess, the Ave Maria,
thus elevated in the very centre of the city. The mosque,
thus boldly sanctified by Fernando Perez del Pulgar, was
eventually, after the capture of Granada, converted into a
cathedral.&mdash;<i>Washington Irving, Chronicle of the Conquest of
Granada</i>, chap. 91.</p>

A celebrated oracle; those who entered the cave are
commonly said never to have smiled again. It appears,
however, from Pausanias, that this loss of the important
faculty which is said to distinguish men from brutes was
only temporary. The method of consulting the oracle was
singular. The aspirant descended into a cave, where was a
small crevice, into which he proceeded to insinuate himself
feet foremost. So soon as he had got his knees in, the whole
body was sucked forwards by an overpowering force, and
after passing through the circuit of the mysteries, he was
ejected, feet foremost, at the place where he had entered.</p>

In the celebrated interview between Solon and Cr&oelig;sus,
the sage first offended the king by questioning the power
of wealth to produce happiness, and concluded by reading
him a long moral lesson, to the purport, that since no man
knew what the morrow might produce, no man could be
called happy until present prosperity was crowned by a happy
death.</p>

M. de Masson asserts (it is to be taken on his authority,
not on ours) that he knew a lady of the Russian court, in
the reign of Catherine II., who kept a slave who was her
perruquier shut up in a cage in her own chamber. She let
him out every day to arrange her head&ndash;dress, and locked him
up again with her own hands after the business of the toilet
was over. His box was placed at her bed&ndash;head, and in this
fashion he attended her wherever she went. His fare was
bread and water. He passed three years in this captivity,
the object of which was to conceal from all the world that
the lady wore a wig. The close confinement was a punishment
for running away from her service; the meagre diet
a measure of revenge, because he could not prevent her
growing older and uglier every day.&mdash;<i>Mémoires Secrets sur
la Russie.</i></p>

In Epirus, 150,000 persons are said to have been enslaved
by L. Æmilius Paulus. In Cæsar’s Gallic wars
1,000,000 prisoners were taken and of course sold. (<i>Plin.
Hist. Nat.</i> vii. 25.) Another million is said to have been
slain: but these round numbers may be suspected to be much
exaggerated. Upwards of 100,000 Jews, according to Josephus,
were reduced to slavery by Titus. Cicero says of
Britain, “It is well known that there is not a drachm of
silver in the island, and no hope of booty except in slaves;
and among them you will hardly find learned men or musicians.”

We cannot deny this merit at least to what is called,

many were “sans peur,” and thereby escaped one most

illustrates the same point in a much smaller compass, seemed
better fitted for insertion in the text; but the other gives
such a minute and pleasant representation of manners, that
we cannot altogether omit it; and it is too long for a note.</p>

Apis was a black calf, with a square white spot on its
forehead, the figure of an eagle on its back, a double tuft
of hair on its tail, and the figure of the cantharus, the sacred
beetle, under its tongue. When an animal bearing these
marks was found, or manufactured, the birth of Apis was announced
to the people, a temple was built on the spot, where
he was fed for four months, and after various ceremonies he
was finally conveyed to Memphis, where he spent the rest of
his life in a splendid palace, receiving divine honours.</p>

<p class="pfn6 p1">The ground work of this passage is to be found in Holinshed;
and the same tale is told in Fabyan’s Chronicles, and
in Restell’s Pastime of Pleasure. The latter writers state it
without any appearance of doubt. But Holinshed uses a degree
of caution not very common in a chronicler of that time:
“Whether this was true that so he spake, as one that gave
too much credit to foolish prophecies and vain tales, or whether
it was fained, as in such cases it commonly happeneth,
we leave it to the advised reader to judge.” The advised
reader will probably hesitate little in adopting the latter conclusion;
especially as the same tale is told of other persons.
See the notes to Shakspeare, in the edition of 1821. The
actors and the scenes differ in the different cases; but the
equivoque arises in all upon the name “Jerusalem.”</p>

Loss of sensation or a depraved state of sensation in the
extremities, is a common symptom of madness. Where the
former exists, it is not uncommon for patients to burn themselves
dreadfully, from mere insensibility to the action of
fire. The latter is often manifested by a sort of irritation
which leads the sufferer to cut and lacerate the hands and
feet. These facts, with a little allowance for exaggeration,
may do something to explain rather a startling passage.&mdash;See

The Furies. These goddesses were worshipped with
mysterious veneration by the Athenians, who held it an ill
omen to call them by their proper name, and spoke of them
as the venerable goddesses (<i>σεμνὰι θεὰι</i>), or the Eumenides,
because they had been propitious (<i>ἐυμενεῖς</i>) to Orestes after
his acquittal by the court of Areopagus. This was owing
partly to a general dislike of alluding to gloomy subjects,
which led them, among other things, to avoid speaking
openly of death or the dead (hence the phrases <i>ὁι καμόντες,
ὁι κατοιχόμενοι</i>, those who are worn out, the departed, &amp;c.);
partly to wishing to propitiate an object of dread by fair words,
as the Highlanders called fairies “men of peace,” especially
on a Friday, when their power was greatest, and the Lowlanders
entitled them “good neighbours,” and the devil
himself the “goodman,” keeping reverentially out of sight
his territorial designation.</p>

Some modern historical instances of a similar superstitious
feeling are given lower down in the text. Its nature,
however, cannot be better illustrated than by reference to
the legend attaching to the family of Redgauntlet in the
novel of that name. The downfall of the house of Ravenswood,
in the admirable tale of the Bride of Lammermoor,
though foretold and fated, is not sufficiently identified with
the story of the Mermaid’s Well, to be quoted on this occasion.
If it were so, that work, from the severe grandeur of its
serious parts, and the singularly impressive way in which
all events, and all agency, human and supernatural, combine
from the outset to bring about a catastrophe, foreseen and
prophesied, but not the less inevitable, would offer to the
English reader an excellent example of the spirit of the
superstitions and tragedies here alluded to, though widely
differing from them in form.</p>

A similar belief existed in England with respect to the
alienations of church property at the Reformation, of which
the following is a remarkable instance.</p>
<p class="pfc6">
Sir Walter Raleigh was gifted by Queen Elizabeth with
the lands of Sherborne in Dorsetshire, which had been bequeathed
by Osmund, a Norman knight, to the see of Canterbury,
with a heavy denunciation against any rash or profane
person who should attempt to wrest them from the
church. This anathema was, in the opinion of the vulgar,
first accomplished in the person of the Protector Somerset,
to whom, after sundry vicissitudes, the property belonged.
This nobleman was hunting in the woods of Sherborne when
his presence was required by Edward the Sixth, and he was
shortly afterwards committed to the Tower, and subsequently
beheaded. The forfeited estate then lapsed to the See of
Salisbury until the reign of Elizabeth, to whom it was made
over by the bishop, at the instigation of Raleigh, who was
blamed, and apparently with justice, for having displayed on
this occasion a grasping and even dishonourable spirit. So
strong were the religious prejudices of the day, that even
the discerning Sir John Harrington attributed to a judgment
from heaven a trifling accident which occurred to Raleigh
while surveying the demesne which he coveted. Casting
his eyes upon it, according to the notion of that writer, as
Ahab did upon Naboth’s vineyard, and, in the course of a
journey from Plymouth to the coast, discussing at the same
time the advantages of the desired possession, Sir Walter’s
horse fell, and the face of the rider, then, as the relater observes,
“thought to be a very good one,” was buried in the
ground. After Raleigh’s fall the estate was seized by James
the First, who wished to bestow it on his favourite, Car, Earl
of Somerset; but Prince Henry interfered, and obtained possession,
intending to restore it to the owner. The prince’s death,
however, frustrated his intentions, and left Sherborne still
in the favourite’s hands. The premature death of this promising
youth was thought by the vulgar again to corroborate
the old prophecy. To Carew, the youngest son, and the
injured survivor of Sir Walter, the subsequent attainder of
Car, and the forfeiture of his estates upon his committal to
the Tower, appeared to confirm the ill fortune attendant upon
the owners of Sherborne; and the misfortunes which afterwards
befell the house of Stuart were also considered by him
to corroborate the old presage. On the confiscation of Car’s
estates, Digby, Earl of Bristol, obtained Sherborne from the
king, and in his family it now remains.&mdash;<i>Life of Sir W.
Raleigh, by Mrs. Thomson</i>, chap. vi.</p>

He is accused, however, of having interpolated several
lines to gratify Athenian vanity, and one with a deeper view;
that, namely, which says of Ajax, that he ranged his own
alongside of the Athenian ships (Il. ii. 558) with the purpose
of strengthening Athens’ claim to Salamis, then hotly contested
by Megara. The Megarian versions said, on the
other hand, that Ajax led ships from Salamis, and from
Polichne, Nisæa, and other towns of Megaris. Both this
trick, and the credit of collecting Homer’s poems, are ascribed
by other authors to Solon. Some eminent modern
scholars have doubted whether this arrangement and revision
ever took place.&mdash;See Knight, Proleg. ad Hom. § 4, 5.</p>

Much doubt has arisen which of these was the elder.
Thucydides says, contrary to the general opinion, that it was
Hippias, and he seems to be corroborated by Herodotus; but
it is a question of no importance, and not worth discussion.
Pisistratus left a third legitimate son, named Thessalus, of
whom scarce any mention is made in history, and a natural

Sigeum, on the Hellespont.</p>

Not the Hesperides, but an island called Achilleia, or
Leuce, at the mouth of the Danube, consecrated to Achilles,
where his tomb was visible. The hero, however, must have
been there in proper person, since he espoused either Helen or
Iphigenia, and had a son by her. Here he dwelt in perpetual
youth, with Diomed, the Ajaxes, and other heroes.
Many mythological tales are related concerning the island.
Birds swept and sprinkled the temple of Achilles with water
from their wings: passing vessels often heard the sound of
sweet yet awe&ndash;inspiring music; others distinguished the
din of arms and horses and the shouts of battle. If vessels
anchored for the night off the island, Achilles and Helen
would come on board, drink with the sailors, and sing them
the verses of Homer, with particulars of their personal
adventures, even of the most delicate description. Once a
man who ventured to sleep upon the island was awoke by
Achilles, and taken home to sup with him, when the hero
played the lyre, and Patroclus served wine: Thetis and
other gods were there. Many other stories, equally amusing
and no less worthy of credit, are related concerning this
wonderful place.&mdash;<i>Bayle, art. Achilleia.</i></p>

book to translate from the original accounts of Machiavelli,

“Conspiring against one prince,” says Machiavelli, “is
a doubtful and dangerous undertaking; but to conspire
against two at the same time must be either downright folly
or madness:” and he enforces his principle by the examples
of the Pazzi and of Harmodius and Aristogiton. “Pelopidas,”
he adds, “had ten tyrants instead of two to deal with:”
it would be very dangerous, however, for any man to build
on the success of this conspiracy, which, indeed, was almost
miraculous, and is mentioned by all writers who speak of it,
as not only a rare, but almost unexampled event.&mdash;<i>Political
Discourses</i>, book iii. chap. 6.</p>

Machiavelli has drawn a shrewd caution to conspirators
from the failure of the attack upon Lorenzo. “It is necessary,
in undertakings of this kind, to make use of men that
have been sufficiently hardened and tried, and to trust no
others, how courageous soever they may be accounted: for
no man can answer even for his own resolution, if he have
not thoroughly proved it before; for the confusion he must
naturally be in at such a time may either make him drop the
dagger out of his hand, or say something which may have
the same effect. Lucilla, sister to Commodus, having spirited
up Quintianus to kill her brother, he waited for him as he
came to the amphitheatre, and stepping up towards him with
a drawn dagger in his hand, told him ‘the senate had sent him
that:’ upon which he was immediately seized before he got
near enough to stab him. Antonio de Volterra being fixed
upon to kill Lorenzo de’ Medici, cried out, as he advanced to
kill him, ‘Ha! traitor!’ which proved the preservation of
Lorenzo, and the ruin of the conspiracy.”&mdash;<i>Political Discourses</i>,

The family arms of the Medici were six golden balls
(palle d’oro). They asserted that this bearing was derived
from the impressions left on the shield of one of their ancestors
by a gigantic Saracen, who wielded a mace with six iron
globes hung from it. Their detractors said that they were
the arms of an apothecary, from whom the family derived
the name of Medici, and that the golden balls were nothing
better than gilded pills.</p>

which Herodotus accounted for it.</p>

Some curious particulars remain concerning the Getæ,
whom he encountered on his march. They believed in the
immortality of the soul, as taught them by their lawgiver
Zalmoxis, or as the name is otherwise read, Zamolxis, and in,
a future state of happiness. Every fifth year they sent a
messenger to inform Zalmoxis, whom they had deified, of
their wants, in this manner. Choosing a man by lot, they
first give him full instructions as to the purport of his embassy,
and then certain men, taking him by the hands and
feet, toss him in the air, others hold three spears placed so
that he might fall upon them. If he die immediately, Zalmoxis
is thought to be favourably disposed; if not, they call
the messenger a scoundrel, and proceed to make trial of
somebody else.</p>

The reader may compare the following passage of
Froissart, chap. xviii. The English army were in pursuit of
the Scots, then employed in ravaging Northumberland under
the Earl of Douglas, who was strongly posted upon a hill
side, with a deep and rocky river in his front. “And there
were harauldis of armes sent to the Scottis gyvyng them knowledge
if that they would come and passe the ryver to fight
with them in the playne felde, they wolde draw backe fro
the ryver, and gyve theym sufficient place to arraynge theyr

therwith, lette them amend it whan they wyll, for here we

sort were often given in the days of chivalry, and not unfrequently
accepted.</p>

genowayes were assembled toguyder, and beganne to approche,
they made a grete leape, and crye, to abasshe
thenglysshemen, but they stode styll, and styredde nat for
all that: than the genowayes agayne the second tyme made
another leape, and a fell crye, and stepped forward a lyttell,
and thenglysshemen remeued nat one fote: thirdly agayne
they leapt, and cryed, and went forth tyll they came within
shotte; than they shotte feersly with their crosbowes; than
thenglysshe archers stept forth one pase, and lette fly their
arowes so holly and so thycke, that it seemed snow: when
the genowayes felte the arowes persynge through heedes,
armes, and brestes, many of them cast downe their crosbowes,
and dyde cut their strings, and retourned dyscomfited.
When the French kynge sawe them flye away, he sayd, slee
these raskalles, for they shall let and trouble us without
reason: than ye shulde have seen the men at armes dasshe
in amonge them, and kylled a grete nombre of them: and
ever styll the englysshemen shot whereas they saw thickest
preace; the sharp arowes ranne into the men of armes, and
into their horses, and many fell, horse and men, amonge the
genowayes: and whan they were downe, they coulde nat
relyve again, the preace was so thicke that one overthrewe
another.”&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, chap. 130.
So at the battle of Homildoun, Percy wished to charge
the Scots, who were drawn up upon a hill, but the Earl of
March retained him, and bid him open their ranks by
archery. “Then the English archers marching against the
Scots, <i>stitched them together</i> with arrows, and made them
bristle like a hedgehog, as it were with thorns and prickles;
the hands and arms of the Scots they nailed to their own
lances, so that with that sharp shower of arrows some they
overthrew, others they wounded, and very many they slew.
Upon which the valiant Sir John Swinton exclaimed, as
with the voice of a herald, ‘My noble fellow&ndash;soldiers, what
has bewitched you, that you give not way to your wonted
gallantry: that you rush not to the mellay, hand to hand,
nor pluck up heart like men, to attack those who would
slaughter you with arrows, like hinds in a park. Let such
as will go down with me, and in God’s name we will break
into the enemy and so either come off with life, or else fall
knightly with honour.’”&mdash;(<i>Fordun, Scotichr.</i> lib. xv. cap.
14.) One manuscript adds, “I have never heard nor read
that the English in fair field beat an equal number of Scots
by charge of lance, but very often by the thunder&ndash;shower
(<i>fulminatione</i>) of their arrows. Let the latter therefore
beware of waiting the flight of archery, but hasten to close
combat, even as Sir John Swinton then did.” This is the
story which Sir Walter Scott has worked up into his poem
of Halidon Hill.</p>

In European warfare, overthrown knights were often
unable to rise from the incumbrance of their ponderous
defences, and not very unfrequently suffocated by dust, heat,
and want of air.</p>

Examples of a similar high sense of honour might be
multiplied from the history of chivalry. Once during his
crusade Richard C&oelig;ur&ndash;de&ndash;Lion saw a party of Templars surrounded
and overmatched by Saracens, and being unarmed,
sent some of his barons to support the Christians until he
himself should be ready for combat. “Meanwhile an overpowering
force of the enemy came up, and when he arrived
at the field, the danger appeared so imminent, that he was
entreated not to hazard his own person in the unequal contest.
The king replied, his colour changing with his boiling
blood, ‘Sith I have sent dear comrades to battle with a
promise of following to assist them, if, as I have engaged, I
do not defend them with all my strength, but being absent,
and wanting, which Heaven forbid, they should meet death,
I will never again usurp the name of king.’ So with no
more words, rushing into the midst of the Turks like a thunderbolt,
he pierced through, and cut them down and dispersed
them, and then with many prisoners and his friends
delivered, he returned to the camp.”&mdash;(<i>Broad Stone of Honour</i>,
book iv. p. 174.)&mdash;So also the Marquis de Villena, a
distinguished warrior of the court of Ferdinand of Arragon,
being asked by Queen Isabella why he had exposed his own
life to save a trusty servant nearly overpowered by odds,
replied, “Should I not peril one life to serve him, who would
have adventured three, had he possessed them, for me?”</p>

So Xenophon says, in the Anabasis, that the Persians
never encamped less than 60 stadia (6 or 7 miles) from
the Greeks. “The Persian army is a bad thing by night.
For their horses are tethered, and shackled also for the
most part, that they may not run away if they get loose:
and if there be any disturbance, the Persian has to saddle
and bridle his horse, and mount him loaded with his armour,
which is all difficult by night, especially in any tumult.
For these reasons they encamped away from the Grecians.”</p>

North’s Plutarch; Life of Crassus. This statement of
numbers, though large, is not incredible, since the army originally
consisted of seven legions, besides 4000 horse and as
many light&ndash;armed infantry; and few appear to have effected
their escape.</p>

A city founded by the Parthians as the capital of their

The history of Julian’s campaign is full of interest, and will
repay the perusal. It has, however, no particular connexion
with the subject of this chapter, which has already
reached length sufficient to preclude the introduction of extraneous
matter, and we therefore are compelled to take up
the narrative of Julian’s proceedings only at the point where
his misfortunes commenced.</p>

The night before Julian consented to accept the imperial
purple at the hands of his rebellious army, he saw in a
vision (so at least he told his friends) one with the attributes
of the tutelary genius of the empire. The phantom complained
that hitherto his desire to serve the sleeper had been,
frustrated, and warned him to accept the proffered dignity
as he valued the continuance of his care and protection.</p>

Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, was remarkable for the
favourable issue of all his undertakings. Amasis, king of
Egypt, wrote thus to him: “It is pleasant to hear of the
good fortune of a friend and connexion; but your extraordinary
prosperity pleases not me, knowing, as I do, that the
Deity is envious: and I would have those for whom I am
interested meet both with success and failure, and think a
chequered life better than unclouded fortune. For I have
never heard of any man who, being prosperous in all things,
has not at last perished miserably, root and branch. Be persuaded,
then, and take this precaution against your good
fortune; select whatever you have most valuable, and would
most regret to lose, and so bestow this that it shall never
come to man again; and if, in future, good and evil fortune
are not blended, remedy it in the manner which I now propose.”
Polycrates took the advice and cast into the sea an
engraved gem of extraordinary value; and within a few days
a fish was presented to him within which the gem was found.
Amasis, hearing of it, renounced all friendship and connexion
with him, as a man predestined to an evil fate. The event
must have strongly confirmed the notion from which the
advice proceeded; for Polycrates having given offence to the
satrap of Sardis, or, as is more likely, being considered too
powerful and dangerous a neighbour to remain on the Ionian
coast, was entrapped into that nobleman’s power, and crucified
by him.&mdash;Herod. iii. 40.</p>

It is curious that Kutusoff and Napoleon were actually
retreating from Malo&ndash;Yarowslavitch, the scene of the battle,
at the same moment; the one fearing another attack, the

During the whole retreat only one corps grounded arms
to the enemy, and that not until it was surrounded and cut
off from the main army, and reduced to extremity. This
occurred just before the passage of the Beresina.</p>

To get at the exact truth is no easy matter, even where
the means of ascertaining it seem most ample. General
Gourgaud, who also served in 1812, has published an elaborate
criticism of the Comte de Segur’s work, in which he
maintains that the difficulties and losses of the passage of
the Beresina have been excessively exaggerated,&mdash;that the
French had 250 guns, which commanded the opposite bank,
and 45,000 men under arms,&mdash;and that of women and
children, whom Segur is always fond of introducing, there
were next to none. Throughout the narrative we have
followed Segur’s account, as generally considered most
authoritative, though he seems fond of writing for effect,
and his accounts, as far as disparity of numbers in this latter
part of the retreat is concerned, are somewhat startling.</p>
